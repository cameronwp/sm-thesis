  - oh wait we tried it and it sucked

* Coordinating Multiple Agents under Uncertain Communication
<<ch:technical-coordination>>

In this chapter, we present a novel MA framework for dynamic event scheduling with inter-agent
temporal constraints. Our framework adheres to the variable observation delay modeling framework
presented in Chapter [[ch:modeling-tn]], making it robust to uncertain communication.

Online MA coordination of event dispatching allows executives to dynamically decide when to act
given the resolution of inter- and intra-agent temporal constraints. In our formulation, each
executive has its own STNU with contingent events it expects to observe and free events it is
responsible for monitoring. We do not distinguish between contingent events that are the free events
scheduled by peer agents and contingent events from any other source in Nature. There are no
restrictions on inter-agent constraints, though they must avoid chained contingencies the same way
that vanilla, single-agent STNUs do [cite:@MMV2001].


# 2. Executives are allowed to ignore observations.
Executives are /not/ required to have perfect knowledge of the complete state of the world with
respect to event assignments, nor are they required to even /agree/ on the state of the world.
Rather, their knowledge should be consistent with the temporal constraints and observation delay
modeled in their individual delay STNUs. This requirement stands in opposition to the communication
challenge that is commonly addressed in problems involving distributed agents, e.g. distributed
consensus approaches [cite:@Ongaro2014;@Lamport1998], where it is crucial that all agents agree on
the state of the world. In our framework, each agent acts according to their given constraints. Due
to scheduling uncertainty from observation delay, it is impossible to expect agents to agree on
partial histories, nor is it necessary because each agent is capable of scheduling events with
observation uncertainty.
# 2. /All/ inter-agent communications must be explicitly modeled.

# TODO not sure if this passes muster
# The second requirement ensures that we do not make the assumption of instantaneous communication. If
# there are inter-agent constraints in an agent's delay STNU, then those constraints must be
# associated with observation delay. This provides a guarantee that, should the delay STNU be found to
# be controllable, the schedule accounts for uncertain communication between agents. This requirement
# also motivates defining a method for sharing observations between agents.

To our knowledge, no such online scheduler for MA coordination with this requirement has been
proposed. In this chapter, we first present a grounded Artemis-like scenario to motivate
coordination. Next, we describe a modeling framework for MA control programs that is necessary for
establishing coordination between agents. Then we define an event propagation algorithm used to
guarantee that event observations match individual agent STNUs. We finish by presenting experimental
analysis of our event propagation algorithms, and the results of hardware demonstrations of Delay
Kirk using a robotic arm and a simulated astronaut.

# The astronaut and robot need to agree on the order of events relevant to coordination.


** Event Propagation
<<sec:event-propagation>>

# TODO something about no retries here?

# Algos for graph structure of event comms

At a high level, scheduled events propagate through a simple directed graph of connected executives.
We put checks in place to ensure that cycles do not cause infinitely recursed event observations.

# #+label: def:communication-responsibility
# #+latex: \begin{defn}
# #+latex: \label{defc:communication-responsibility}
# *Communication Responsibilities*

# For a MA scheduling problem, the /communication responsibilities/ is a set of tuples $\langle p, s
# \rangle$, where:
# - $p$ is a publishing executive,
# - $s$ is a subscribing executive.
# #+latex: \end{defn}

#+label: def:communication-graph
#+latex: \begin{defn}
#+latex: \label{def:communication-graph}
*Communication Graph*

A /communication graph/ $C$ is a tuple $\langle V, E \rangle$, where:
- $V$ is a set of vertices representing peer executives,
- $E$ is a set of directed edges between $v \in V$ representing the path of event observation
  propagation,
- Each edge $e_{i} \in E$ is a pair $(o, t)$, where $o, t \in V$ represent the origin and
  termination of the edge respectively.

Self-loops, or self-edges, are not allowed, i.e. for any vertex $v_{i} \in V$, no single edge $e_{i}
\in E$ may both originate and terminate at $v_{i}$.
#+latex: \end{defn}

# TODO insert sample graph here

For some executive $v_{i} \in V$ with outgoing edges in $E$, $(v_{i}, v_{j})$, $\cdots$, $(v_{i},
v_{k})$, any scheduled events that $v_{i}$ assigns, whether free or contingent, are propagated to
all peer executives $v_{j}$, $\cdots$, $v_{k}$. Likewise, all contingent events received from Nature
are propagated to peers. Finally, any events $v_{i}$ receives from other agents are also relayed to
peers.

# Note that $C$ is wholly distinct from individual STNUs and inter-agent temporal constraints.

#+label: def:event-propagations
#+latex: \begin{defn}
#+latex: \label{def:event-propagations}
*Event Propagation Messages*

An /event propagation message/ $m$ is a tuple $\langle x, P \rangle$, where:
- $x$ is a set of one or more events scheduled simultaneously,
- $P \subseteq V$ is a set of executives who have already received the message.
#+latex: \end{defn}

Recognize that Definition [[def:event-propagations]] is vague in defining $x$. Event propagation
messages are passed between agents, and each agent has its own STNU. In some cases, $x$ will be free
events, in others $x$ will be contingent events. The type of event makes no difference to the
algorithm so we do not distinguish between them here.

Events that are received in $m$, $m[x]$, are handled the same as observations of contingent events
during scheduling. Lemmas [[lemma:information-fixes-bounds]], [[lemma:ignore-inf-delay]], and
[[lemma:subtract-gamma]] are applied as appropriate when the observation of $m[x]$ arrives.

# TODO clean up

# we can always ignore events
# agents are likely to receive more events than they care about

For an edge $(v_{i}, v_{j}) \in E$, it is possible that $v_{j}$ receives events that are not present
in its STNU.

Because we have not defined a temporal decoupling-like algorithm wherein an STNU for multiple-agents
is programmatically separated into individual STNUs (see the discussion of multi-agent STNUs
[cite:@Casanova2016] in Section [[sec:mastnus]]), we are reliant on human planners to write STNUs for
each agent by hand. As a result, there is no guarantee that $x$ is meaningful to a given agent.

To be more specific, there is no guarantee that any event $x_{i} \in x$ in the event propagation
message has an equivalent event in $X_{c}$ of the STNU being executed by any receiving agent $v_{j}
\in V$. If agent $v_{j}$ cannot find $x_{i}$ in their $X_{c}$, then $x_{i}$ can be ignored. As will
be discussed in Algorithm [[alg:event-propagation]], we represent $x$ using a type that can be compared
for equivalence with the events in an agent's STNUs, e.g. a list of strings.

# ODOT

We use $P$ to avoid cycles in event propagation. As will be shown in Algorithm
[[alg:event-propagation]], agent $v_{i}$ will avoid propagating $x$ to any agents in $P$. Agent $v_{i}$
will also grow $P$ when it relays $m$ to other agents by appending to $P$ itself and all outgoing
agents $v_{j}, \cdots, v_{k}$.

Timing information, e.g. timestamps, is explicitly excluded from $m$. Dynamic scheduling and the
variable-delay STNU and event observation, $\obs$, formalisms do not account for timestamps.
Instead, we expect that passing messages for event propagation between executives takes an amount of
time in the domain $\mathbb{R^{+}}$. Thus, when $v_{j}$ expects to receives an event, $x_{i} \in x$,
from $v_{i}$, the time delay can be naturally modeled in the variable-delay function,
$\gammabar({x_{i}})$, in the STNU that $v_{j}$ will execute.

If event propagation messages were to include accurate timestamps, we would need to modify the way
events are recorded during scheduling, impacting scheduling Lemmas [[lemma:information-fixes-bounds]],
[[lemma:ignore-inf-delay]], and [[lemma:subtract-gamma]]. Scheduling events in the past could also impact
controllability. For these reasons, we avoid the inclusion of timestamps in event propagation
messages.

By Definition [[def:event-propagations]], events received from other agents are no different than events
received from Nature, and no special considerations are required for scheduling.

We now walk through the process of passing messages between agents as shown in Algorithm
[[alg:event-propagation]]. We use the same /Event Propagation/ algorithm in three cases:

1. When an agent $v_{i}$ schedules free events $x$,
2. When $v_{i}$ receives an observation from Nature of contingent events $x$,
3. When $v_{i}$ receives an incoming message $m_{i}$ with contingent events $m_{i}[x]$ from another
   agent in $V$.

Let =peers= be a mutable set initialized to the terminal vertices for all $e \in E$ originating at
$v_{i}$.

In the first case, agent $v_{i}$ fulfills its responsibilities as defined in $C$ by broadcasting $x$
to its =peers=, who will receive $x$ as exogenous contingent events. The outgoing message $m_{o}$
that will be passed to =peers= will include enough information such that no agent should receive a
given $x$ more than once. To do so, we let $P$ be a set of all agents that will have observed $x$
when $m_{o}$ is received by =peers=, $P = \{ v_{i}, p~ \forall~ p \in \texttt{peers} \}$. We
finalize $m_{o} = \langle x, P \rangle$, which we simultaneously transmit to each $p$ in =peers=.
Transmission is a "fire and forget" operation, where $v_{i}$ does not wait for acknowledgment from
any $p$ that $m_{o}$ was received.

The second case plays out the same as the first, the only difference being that $x$ is itself
observed from Nature. Once again, we let $P$ be a list of $v_{i}$ and all =peers=, and then transmit
$m_{o}$ simultaneously to all =peers=.

The third case is a relay operation. Agent $v_{i}$ is responsible for propagating events $m_{i}[x]$
that it has just observed, but we want to avoid sending the events to =peers= who have already
observed them. We remove those agents from =peers= accordingly with a set difference operation:
=peers= $= \texttt{peers} - m_{i}[P]$. Likewise, we grow the list of agents who have received $x$,
which is now $P = P \cup \texttt{peers}$. Agent $v_{i}$ composes a new $m_{o} = \langle m_{i}[x], P
\rangle$ and transmits it to =peers=.

Ideally, the Event Propagation algorithm should run on a separate thread from the main scheduling
loop, else we run the risk of incurring unnecessary delays in observing and dispatching events.

#+end_export

The complexity of Algorithm [[alg:event-propagation]] is trivially $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of
executives in $V - 1$. The limiting factor to the performance of Event Propagation will be the time
it takes to transmit messages between agents, which, to reiterate, should be modeled in the delay
functions for any inter-agent temporal constraints.

** Experimental Analysis
<<sec:ma-experimental>>

# TODO HTTP technically has more than one message passed. discuss other protocols and when you would want to use them here?

# TODO improve generally. not quite right
We performed two demonstrations of the Event Propagation algorithm. The first was a hardware
demonstration performed on a Barrett WAM manipulator in the MERS lab. The second is a multi-agent
simulation showcasing inter-agent constraints. Both will be described below.

*** Distributed Kirk Simulation
<<sec:dkirk-simulation>>

To demonstrate multi-agent communication, we built a simulation of an end-to-end mission with three
independent Kirks, =agent0=, =agent1=, and =agent2=. We will show that distributed Kirks can
successfully dispatch events within temporal bounds in the face of multiple sources of communication
uncertainty. The Kirks are responsible for executing an installation procedure with the same
randomly generated constraints as used in the validation of the delay scheduler in Section
[[sec:scheduling-experimental]]. In this scenario, each agent is responsible for installing two
satellite dishes with staggered confirmations so as to limit uplink bandwidth usage. As Kirks
receive confirmation that installation has been completed, they then share the confirmations with
their peers.

To simplify comparing schedules, we used a standardized format for event names. Repeated event names
are given as =Event:[agent]:[iteration]=, where =[agent]= and =[iteration]= are zero-indexed. For
instance, =Install:4:3= would be the start of an installation episode for a hypothetical =agent4=
(of at least five agents) in its fourth iteration.

There is one modification from the original constraints from Section [[sec:scheduling-experimental]] in
that we separate the communication delay inherent to the confirmation task with the observation
delay inherent to sharing observations with peers. There may be a delay waiting for confirmation
from ground, and the /in situ/ communication infrastructure may add an additional delay to
communications between agents. We assume the sources of delay compound. For instance, =agent1= will
need to know when =agent0= has confirmed its installation task, =Confirm:0:0= before beginning their
own installation, =Install:1:0=. if =agent0= expects to receive =Confirm:0:0= with an observation
delay of $\gammabar(\texttt{Confirm:0:0}) = [0, 10]$, we increase
$\gammabar^+(\texttt{Confirm:0:0})$ by one for any peers that receive the observation broadcasted
from =agent0=. In other words, from the perspective of =agent1= or =agent2=,
$\gammabar(\texttt{Confirm:0:0}) = [0, 11]$ instead.

#+caption: The Kirk architecture used to generate event assignments for the centralized delay STNU. A single Kirk receives the VDC STNU that includes constraints for all agents, as well as contingent event observations. Kirk then performs delay scheduling, resulting in an assignment to all events.
[[file:../images/demo-centralized.png]]

At a high-level, our procedure for creating this demonstration is as follows. We randomly generated
a variable-delay STNU for three agents and two installation procedures (using the same generator
code that was used in Section [[sec:scheduling-experimental]]) and confirmed it to be VDC. We call this
STNU the /centralized delay STNU/ in that it includes all constraints for all three agents in a
multi-agent mission with observation delay. We then acted like a mission planner in that we manually
decoupled the centralized delay STNU into three single-agent RMPL control programs. Each control
program contained the subset of the constraints from the centralized delay STNU required for a
single agent to maintain the semantics of the original constraints. We call the variable-delay STNUs
represented by the collection of the three RMPL control programs the /distributed variable-delay
STNUs/. We finally pre-determined when observations would arrive for each agent to simplify running
the demonstration. Both the centralized and distributed scenarios received observations of the same
events at the same times.

The architecture for the centralized scenario is shown in Figure [[fig:demo-centralized]], while the
distributed scenario is represented in Figure [[fig:demo-distributed]]. Figure [[fig:demo-distributed]]
presents a simplified view in order to keep the diagram readable. In reality, each Kirk broadcasts
all events to all peers.

#+label: fig:demo-distributed
#+attr_latex: :width \textwidth
#+caption: The distributed architecture for the demonstration. The original centralized delay STNU is manually decoupled to three separate RMPL control programs, which are then used to initialize three Kirks. The Kirks receive appropriate event observations, which they then share to their peers. After delay scheduling, each Kirk produces an assignment to events that were under their control.
[[file:../images/demo-distributed.png]]

Event observations were arranged as follows. In the centralized case, the single Kirk received all
contingent event observations. Any observations that were not explicitly provided as an observation
was assumed to be assigned at its upper bound. In the distributed case, Kirks were only given event
observations for events that belong to them. For instance, only =agent0= received an observation of
=Confirm:0:0=, the event signifying that they have completed installation of the first satellite. It
was then the responsibility of =agent0= to broadcast the event observation to its peers.

To evaluate the ability of a distributed Kirk architecture to perform scheduling with communication
uncertainty, we focus on the schedules produced. To do so, we compare the schedule created by a Kirk
running against centralized delay STNU (Table [[table:centralized-schedule]]) against the combined schedules
of the three single agents (Tables [[table:agent0-schedule]]-[[table:agent2-schedule]]). If observations
arrive at the same time, both scenarios should yield the same schedules. Importantly, the
inter-agent constraint between overlapping installation tasks should hold in the distributed
scenario. The confirmation events are highlighted in gray in each table for ease of identification.

Running the demonstration was then a matter of running three networked instances of Kirk
simultaneously against three different control programs. We did so using a =Makefile= with three
targets, running =make= with the =-j3= flag, and setting up communications to take place over HTTP.

From the root of the thesis repository, execute =make kirk && make -j3 demo= to run the
demonstration. The resulting schedules will be written to =agent{0,1,2}.txt=. Note that the STNU was
generated directly for the centralized delay STNU, but the STNUs were compiled from RMPL control
programs for the distributed delay STNUs. There are naming differences between the events of the
different schedules due to way control programs receive names in RMPL and the way RMPL control
programs are compiled to STNUs. The event names in schedules in Tables
[[table:centralized-schedule]]-[[table:agent2-schedule]] have been manually altered such that they match here.
See Appendix [[appendix:rmpl]] for a description of the resulting STNUs from RMPL control programs.

We can see in Tables [[table:centralized-schedule]]-[[table:agent2-schedule]] that the three Kirks are able
to avoid overlapping installation tasks using a communication architecture that assume uncertain
communication.

*** Hardware Demonstration
<<sec:hw-demo>>

We envision a scenario with an astronaut and a robot coordinating on the lunar surface. The
astronaut is performing scientific exploration while the robot performs remote construction tasks.
The concept of operations allows for the astronaut to use a rover to traverse away from the robot in
search of promising scientific samples. Due to the position of surface relays and general
uncertainty in lunar topology, there is an uncertain time delay between agents.

Bandwidth between Mission Control on Earth and the Moon is limited. There are low and high bandwidth
communications available to both agents. Low bandwidth is responsible for transmitting critical data
(e.g. suit telemetry), while high bandwidth communications are reserved for purposes such as video
calls and large dumps of scientific data. It is not possible for both the astronaut and the robot to
use high bandwidth communications simultaneously. Thus, there is a need for the agents to coordinate
such that they make effective use of high bandwidth communications without stepping on each others
toes, so to speak.

We hone in on a point in an EVA where there is substantial time delay between the astronaut and
robot. The astronaut has set out far from the robot in search of scientifically interesting rock
samples. Meanwhile, the robot is preparing to perform a drilling operation. The astronaut's sample
collection work involves spectroscopy and video imagery, which is being sent to Mission Control
using the high bandwidth connection. It will take between 15 and 30 minutes to downlink all the
data. As soon as sample collection is over, the robot can use the high bandwidth connection to
stream video back to scientists and engineers on earth while performing a drilling operation.

We say that the astronaut "owns," or is responsible for sharing observations of, the start and end
of the experiment, while the robot similarly owns the drilling operation.

We built a physical demonstration of this scenario of this thesis in our laboratory using a Barrett
WAM manipulator and a simulated astronaut. In this scenario, the astronaut and robot are
collaborating on the lunar surface with uncertain communication delay between them. Throughout this
mission, agents must coordinate with respect to their usage of uplink bandwidth. We choose to focus
on a moment in time where the robot is waiting for the human to finish their use of the uplink
before beginning a bandwidth-heavy task of their own. We assume the agents are moving on the lunar
surface during execution, and as such the observation delay between them changes as well. See Figure
[[fig:hw-demo-overview]] for the laboratory setup.

The architecture of the hardware demonstration is as shown in Figure [[fig:hw-demo-flowchart]]. We ran
two Kirks on the same network. One Kirk was responsible for driving the Barrett WAM, while the other
acted as the decision making logic behind an interface on the astronaut's person (say a tablet,
heads-up-display, or portable computer of some kind).

The laptop ran the Kirk that controls the WAM. It did so by dispatching requirement events to a
separate driver that could translate event names to pre-built trajectories for the WAM. The
trajectories were then published to the WAM's controller as ROS messages. As trajectories were
completed, ROS messages were received by the ROS driver layer, which then sent contingent event
observations back to Kirk.

The Valve Steam Deck (SD), a handheld PC, ran the astronaut's Kirk. The Kirk command line tool
allows users to press a number to trigger the observation of a contingent event. We modified the
output of the video game controller buttons of the Steam Deck such that they would automatically
input the number corresponding to the observation of a contingent event. As the astronaut, Cameron
only needed to press one button (mapped to left on the d-pad) during the run to trigger the
observation.

The laptop and the Steam Deck were on the same local network. Note the cable dangling from the Steam
Deck in Figure [[fig:hw-demo-overview]], which is a USB-C to Ethernet adapter. The Steam Deck was
hardwired to the network for demonstration purposes. Communications occurred over HTTP. To simulate
uncertain communication, a sleep call with a time in the range of $\gammabar(x_{c})$ was injected
into Kirk's function responsible for broadcasting event observations to peers, where
$\gammabar(x_{c})$ was drawn from any contingent event $x_{c} \in X_{c}$ of the receiving agent.

To start a run of the demonstration, we would start both Kirks simultaneously. Each Kirk had their
own RMPL control program, which we include in Listings [[code:astronaut-rmpl]] and [[code:robot-rmpl]]. Note
that the control programs are nearly identical. The control programs related to the high bandwidth
handoff, =human-downlink-science=, =sync=, and =robot-drilling=, differ only in observation delay
and whether the =sync= event is controllable. Adding observation delay reflects uncertain
communication between the agents.

The =sync= control programs were included as synchronization episodes between
=human-downlink-science= and =robot-drilling=. Note that the robot also has a =sync= episode, which
ensures that both agents agree on the naming of events.

We can see the modeling power of variable observation delay in Listings [[code:astronaut-rmpl]] and
[[code:robot-rmpl]]. It is natural that the observation delay between agents may change due to the
evolution of resources during a mission. The variable-delay modeling framework allows us to model
uncertain delay for each temporal constraint independently. For instance, if we know that, say,
agents will be distant during a given constraint, then we may add uncertain delay accordingly. If
agents are collocated during other constraints, then we can safely decrease the observation delay
(absent other sources of delay).

According to the constraints and variable delay of the =human-downlink-science= control program from
the perspective of the robot, the transformed fixed-delay STNU the robot is executing will reflect
constraints of
$\conedge{\texttt{human-downlink-science:start}}{\texttt{human-downlink-science:end}}{[30, 35]}$
with $\gamma(\texttt{human-downlink-science:end}) = 0$ after applying Lemma [[lemma:main-tightening]].

We performed two demonstrations. In the first, the astronaut would observe the end of the science
downlink, the end event of =human-downlink-science:end=, which would trigger a delayed observation
being passed to the robot. Once the robot received the command, it would begin its =robot-drilling=
activity. It passed observations of its scheduled events back to the astronaut.

#+caption: The first demonstration in four parts. (a) $t = 0$, when the two Kirks are started at the same time (unfortunately, the SD is below the image frame). (b) $t = 16$, when the astronaut observed that the science experiment was setup. (c) $t = 23$, when the robot received a delayed observation from the astronaut indicating they had completed science setup. (d) $t > 23$, as the robot performed the drilling task.

The second demonstration focused on the behavior of the delay scheduler when communications are not
received in time. After starting both Kirks at the same time, we unplugged the astronaut's Kirk from
the network. While, in reality, a disconnection should be modeled as $\gammabar^+(x_{c}) = \infty$,
we did it to emphasize the fact that the robot's Kirk would not receive an observation within the
fixed bounds it was expecting. The delay scheduler would then imagine =human-downlink-science:end=
and dispatch its drilling activity accordingly.

(d) $t = 60$, when Kirk has observed the end of the drilling task.

We present the schedules of the agents for both scenarios in Tables
[[table:hw-demo-1-astronaut]]-[[table:hw-demo-2-robot]]. The schedule has been cleaned and the event names
have been modified to better reflect the intent of the RMPL control programs. See Appendix
[[appendix:rmpl]] for an explanation of how RMPL and the STNUs compiled from it are related. We also
removed anonymous (non-named) events that were added in the process of translating RMPL to
variable-delay STNU.

We can see variable observation delay at work by comparing the assigned end times for
=human-setup-science= between the astronaut and robot in Tables [[table:hw-demo-1-astronaut]] and
[[table:hw-demo-1-robot]]. The human knows that science setup was completed at $t = 16$, but the robot
received an observation of the same event after an apparently delay of six seconds.

Note that the robot was running an experimental /optimistic/ version of the delay scheduler in the
demonstration. The difference between the delay scheduler as described in Chapter
[[ch:delay-scheduling]] and the optimistic version is that the optimistic version will attempt to avoid
buffering early contingent events by rewriting the delay STNU based on the early observation and
checking VDC. It will be discussed in more depth in Appendix [[appendix:optimistic-rescheduling]].

Finally, we see in the second experiment that the robot was forced to imagine contingent events due
to communication delay. The robot was able to satisfy all constraints with its drilling episode
despite not receiving communication from the astronaut about the end of the astronaut setting up the
science experiment.
