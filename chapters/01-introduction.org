** EVAs and TRL
The current generation concepts of operations and decision support systems for extravehicular
activities (EVAs) cannot cope with the communication delays and dropouts the next generation of
lunar explorers will face while guaranteeing safe and effective exploration. I propose to develop
low TRL technologies that will enable safe and effective planetary exploration through a decision
support system (DSS) for making real-time decisions with distributed collaboration and coordination
under uncertain communications. The lunar surface is a stochastic environment where the information
found during a mission will impact planning. The situation will be fluid, and as such we need a DSS
that enables continuous planning, whether those plans help teams reach unexpected, high value
science targets, or work around unexpected equipment failures - even when they cannot talk to one
another.

This research proposes to address TA 4.4.5, Distributed Collaboration and Coordination, for a
mixed-initiative system of astronauts, robotic assets, and ground-based support personnel during
exploration EVAs. It will build off existing frameworks for decision-making from autonomy that have
enabled robotic missions with analogous constraints. Combined task and motion planning for
autonomous exploration has been well-demonstrated. Similarly, there is a substantial body of work
behind continuous online planning. Distributed, multi-agent decision making has also been addressed,
however, there has not been a look at how uncertain communications impact how a mixed-initiative
team should dynamically adapt and solve problems in an evolving world.

** gaps
The gap in our understanding of distributed collaboration and coordination that this thesis proposes
to address is deciding how a collaborative agent should act, given a set of constraints between
events, when there is uncertainty about when, /if ever/, communications and observations of
exogenous events are received.

** SA vs MA
...to implement the task scheduling and execution capabilities of a high-level executive that is
capable of facilitating swarm-like coordination, where each agent independently decides how to act
based on their knowledge of their peers' actions. In effect, this thesis describes an executive
designed for single-agent task execution that can seamlessly engage in multi-agent execution when
peers share scheduling knowledge.
** example scenario
What the state of the art lacks is an execution strategy when there is observation (or
communication) delay. Existing execution strategies assume that events are either observed
instantaneously as they happen or never. This is a challenge because, for events that are outside of
our control, we no longer have a guarantee of knowing when they have occurred, yet the task
scheduler must decide when to act such that all constraints are satisfied. To illustrate the
challenge posed by uncertain communication on event scheduling, consider the following scenario.

#+begin_quote
There are two robots, =alpha= and =beta=, collaborating to perform a construction task on a
planetary surface. The task involves uploading large video files documenting their progress back to
engineers in Mission Control. There is limited bandwidth to the ground, so they need to coordinate
their usage of the satellite uplink. At some point in the mission, there is a constraint that
=alpha= should wait between three and five minutes after =beta= has finished uploading a video
before uploading their own video. =alpha= knows exactly when =beta= started uploading because they
were colocated at the time, but since then =alpha= has traversed to a distant location. The video
will take eight to ten minutes to upload. =beta= will send a message to inform =alpha= the upload is
complete, which =alpha= may receive instantaneously or after a delay of up to two minutes. Given
when =alpha= learns that =beta= has finished their upload, how should =alpha= decide when to start
their upload?
#+end_quote

There are two constraints and two sources of uncertainty in the scenario, which we can associate
with three events.

1. The event "=beta= finishes upload" will arrive in $[8, 10]$ (minutes) after "=beta= starts
   upload." Neither =alpha= nor =beta= can control where in $[8, 10]$ the upload is finished.
2. =alpha= will decide where the event "=alpha= starts upload" should be scheduled in $[3, 5]$
   after "=beta= finishes upload."
3. The event "=beta= finishes upload" will be observed by =alpha= in $[0, 2]$ after it occurs.
   Neither =alpha= nor =beta= is guaranteed to know how long the delay is.

We can study a few scenarios to uncover the impact of observation uncertainty on =alpha='s decision
as to when to start uploading. We do so based on when =alpha= receives the observation that =beta=
finished their upload. For simplicity's sake, we assume that $t = 0$ when "=beta= starts upload"
occurs.

- At $t = 8$, =alpha= knows there was no observation delay because the only way the observation
  could have come at $t = 8$ is if the video finished uploading at $t = 8$ and they received the
  message from =beta= instantaneously. They are safe to choose anywhere in $[3, 5]$ to start their
  upload. =alpha= chooses to upload as soon as possible at $t = 11$.
- At $t = 9$, the message from =beta= may have been delayed up to a minute (upload finishes at $t =
  8$ + one minute delay), or it could have been sent as late as $t = 9$ and received
  instantaneously. =alpha= then must choose a time in $[3, 5]$ that is consistent with =beta=
  finishing anywhere in $[8, 9]$. =alpha= chooses to upload at $t = 12$.
- At $t = 10$, =beta= could have finished uploading as early as $t = 8$ (upload finishes at $t =
  8$ + two minute delay) or as late as $t = 10$ if there was no communication delay. =alpha= must
  choose a time to start uploading that is consistent with the range of upload completion times in
  $[8, 10]$. =alpha='s only option is to upload at $t = 13$.
** events
A mature corpus of research in the temporal reasoning community provides the foundation for such a
scheduler. We base our research on the notion of events, which are discrete time points representing
actions, and the timing constraints between events. Written in English, events and constraints might
be stated as "samples must be stowed no more than five minutes after being collected." In this case,
"sample collecting" and "sample stowing" would be two events, with a constraint of $< 5$ minutes
between them. It is the case that constraints between events we can control [cite:@Dechter1991],
events we cannot control [cite:@Vidal1999], constraints between multiple agents
[cite:@Casanova2016], events that may not be observed [cite:@Moffitt2007], and events with variable
observation delay [cite:@Bhargava2018] already give mission planners a robust set of modeling tools
for creating schedules and guaranteeing that all constraints are satisfied during a mission.

** BC
- what will be produced?
  - astronauts need to coordinate. have the problem of communication delay, how can we help them?
  - compare what astronauts would normally do (eg. just using walkie talkies), but we want a digital
    assistant to help them with communications
  - need something to remind astronauts what to do along the way

* Introduction

# ABSTRACT
# As space exploration accelerates and the number of robots and humans working in extreme
# environments grows with it, we must enact autonomous multi-agent coordination in order to safely
# operate in environments that are inherently hostile to communication.

The United States, Europe, private companies, and new space agencies around the world are
collectively urging humanity further into the cosmos with a sense of urgency that has not been seen
since Apollo. We are witness to the great forces of political will, economics, and technological
prowess launching our foothold beyond low Earth orbit and into planetary colonization. From every
perspective, the scale of space exploration is staggering. It will take relentless effort from
untold numbers of people, and our robotic partners, to usher us into the era where interplanetary
travel and living off-world are commonplace. In every envisioned scenario for deep space
exploration, there is a need to coordinate between agents, whether human or robotic, who must find a
way to safely work together in the face of the communication challenges inherent to extreme
environments.

There is good reason to design a system for coordination around the notion of uncertain
communication. We take for granted that communication is easy in our civilized corners of the
Earth's surface. Cellular signals and WiFi are security blankets, tricking us into thinking it must
be easy for /everyone/ to communicate /everywhere/. The fact of the matter is that the communication
is far from a given when you leave civilization. Consider low Earth orbit. The largest artificial
satellite, the International Space Station (ISS), has been in orbit since 1998. Despite that, it
still loses communication with the ground regularly. Satellites with much less robust infrastructure
lose contact with the ground even more often. When astronauts set foot on the South Pole of the Moon
soon as part of the Artemis program,[fn:: https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/] they will find
uncertain satellite coverage and the need to contend against local topology that is hostile to radio
signals [cite:@Coan2020a]. Any robots working near a habitat, or any astronauts collecting samples
nearby, may rely on complicated systems of relays that can provide, at best, unpredictable
communications with nearby /in situ/ agents, let alone Mission Control on Earth. Communications may
be delayed due to passing through multiple relays and the speed of light. Or communications may drop
out altogether when agents accidentally walk behind a big boulder between them and the closest
relay.

The Artemis astronauts will continue a longstanding tradition in the U.S. space program of
performing Extravehicular Activities (EVAs) [cite:@McBarron1994]. Like the Apollo astronauts of the
1960s and 1970s, Artemis astronauts will embark on EVAs wherein crews don spacesuits, egress
landers, and conduct scientific expeditions on the lunar surface. There, they will survey surface
features, collect samples, and in general perform field geology
[cite:@Sonnett1963;@Hurtado2013;@Young2020]. A small number of astronauts are Ph.D. geologists by
trade, and NASA is training others in the principles of field geology up to a notional masters level
of understanding [cite:@Kanelakos2020]. NASA will support the lunar activities of these astronauts
through a vast infrastructure of personnel on the ground, including teams of domain-relevant
scientists. Together with flight controllers and engineers from various disciplines, a science team
on the ground will provide real-time feedback to ensure that Artemis astronauts maximize the
scientific return of their EVAs.

Throughout an EVA, the crew (astronauts with spacesuits on), need to know what to do. Currently,
Mission Control Center (MCC or simply "ground"), a vast infrastructure with hundreds of personnel,
monitors all aspects of EVAs and provides timely guidance to the crew. A key role MCC plays is
keeping the crew on schedule by informing them as to what actions need to be taken and when to take
them [cite:@Miller2017]. Current operations use a mix of manual processes and automated tools[fn::
E.g. [[https://github.com/nasa/maestro]]] for tracking a crew's progress on an EVA timeline. Crews then
rely on verbal communications with MCC, as well as written notes kept on their suits (e.g. Figures
[[fig:bean]] and [[fig:whitson]]), to perform the right actions at the right times. It is not a stretch to
imagine that future spacewalkers will don new spacesuits that feature digital assistants designed to
walk them through procedures. Astronauts may interact with digital assistants through heads up
displays, over voice, or on wrist mounted screens. If communications with MCC are challenged, then
behind a digital assistant will need to be a system capable of providing the same timely advice that
MCC provides today. To do so, it will need to reason over all the actions in an EVA timeline, while
taking into account the current state of what has been done and what needs to be done, in order to
help the crew decide when actions should be performed. We call such a system a /scheduler/.

Of course, astronauts never work alone. In addition to communicating with MCC, crews perform EVAs on
a buddy system, meaning two crew members egress and ingress at the same time. At any given moment,
they may be collocated, distant, working independently, or in tight cooperation. Robotic assets also
play a role. On ISS, crews work with manipulators like the Canadarm [cite:@Hiltz]. Rovers and
robotic systems will almost certainly be present on the Moon. They may /collaborate/ in many ways.
Fundamentally, collaboration is a process of deciding when to perform actions based on when other
agents acted. For instance, taking a picture is a form of collaboration. In Figure [[fig:bean]], Pete
Conrad clearly decided when to snap a photo by observing when Alan Bean held up the sample
container. Maybe Conrad saw Bean getting ready and knew when to act. Or, more likely, Bean told
Conrad over the radio that he was ready for a picture, so Conrad should get the camera ready. We
envision that future digital assistants must facilitate similar collaboration. To do so, each agent
will have their own assistant, each running a scheduler that can reason over timing constraints
between their actions and the actions of their peers.

# ABSTRACT
# To the best of our knowledge, there are no autonomous executives capable of coordinating with
# other agents while independently reasoning over communication delay to decide when to act.

The gap in the current state of the art is that, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such
scheduler that is capable of reasoning over the sources of uncertain communication and observation
delay. Existing schedulers assume instantaneous communications, which is unreasonable on the lunar
surface, or indeed, any extreme environment. Furthermore, state of the art schedulers do not provide
collaborative capabilities that allow multiple agents to work together, especially in the presence
of uncertain communication. This thesis leverages and contributes to temporal reasoning research to
implement such a scheduler for multi-agent (MA) collaboration with uncertain communication, which we
refer to as a /delay scheduler/.

# Thus, the envisioned scheduler is one that works for collaborative, distributed agents in the
# presence of uncertain communication.

# ABSTRACT
# A key gap that must be addressed is a single-agent executive capable of deciding when to act given
# communication delay, which can the form the basis for a multi-agent execution context.

# An end-to-end approach would allow a human mission planner to construct a plan for all agents in the
# mission, separate actions for each agent, and then task agents to coordinate during the mission
# despite observation delay. An important stepping stone to the envisioned multi-agent planning and
# execution scenario is defining a single-agent executive that can decide when to act when the
# information it receives, i.e. observations or communications, has uncertain delay. Such a
# single-agent executive is useful in its own right, and can then form the basis for end-to-end
# multi-agent planning and coordination.

# ABSTRACT
# Existing research has provided insights into temporal reasoning, namely modeling observation delay
# and scheduling actions with temporal constraints, but there is both a need for deciding when to
# schedule events when there is uncertain observation delay, and a need to robustly coordinate
# between agents.


# Scheduling actions in the face of uncertainty is a challenge due to the compounding uncertainties
# of uncontrollable exogenous events, unknown observation delay, and uncertain communication between
# agents.




# TODO this EVA stuff here feels out of place
# A real EVA timeline consists of more than six hours of events with constraints between them
# [cite:@McBarron1994]. For any realistic mission, we can expect hundreds of events, with multiple
# agents /in situ/ and on the ground. Human reasoning over temporal constraints is possible,
# This example demonstrates the type of online temporal reasoning over multiple sources of uncertainty
# required from the perspective of a single agent (=alpha= in this case). We could extend decision
# making to a multi-agent context by alternating our perspective to =beta=, who might then need to
# wait for =alpha= to send a message before its next action. With more constraints, compounding
# sources of uncertainty, and more agents cooperating, the decision as to when to act becomes
# increasingly difficult.

# This thesis proposes to address the following high-level gaps that are required in order to define a
# single-agent task scheduling executive that can participate in a multi-agent context.

# ABSTRACT
# This thesis puts forth a series of contributions that culminates in a robust single-agent
# executive demonstrated to run on real hardware with the ability to coordinate in a multi-agent
# context despite observation delay. We show that single agent online scheduler exhibits the
# expected performance characteristics, and demonstrate multi-agent execution with uncertain
# communication in the context of a simulated astronaut and robotic asset collaborating with
# communication delay.

# 2. Extending existing task scheduling algorithms to implement said execution strategy.

** Problem Statement

A delay scheduler can be used in the case of both one agent (e.g. a single astronaut or a robot)
working individually, as well as when multiple agents are collaborating. We start by defining the
problem statement for the single-agent case, before identifying the features that are necessary for
the MA case.

Consider a spacewalker who is installing an array of satellite dishes on the Moon. The procedure for
installing a single satellite dish is well defined. The procedure involves, say, firmly inserting a
tripod into the lunar regolith, putting a dish on top, bolting the dish in, attaching a few wires,
and waiting to get confirmation from ground that the dish is operational. Sometimes the tripod is
easy to burrow into the regolith, other times it takes a few tries. Sometimes the confirmation comes
quickly, other times it takes time. Some dishes are to be placed close to one another, yet others
should be far apart. Once one dish is done, the astronaut can move on to the next. All the while,
the astronaut's life support system is slowly draining its consumable resources (e.g. oxygen and
battery). Ground wants one dish tested at a time, so the astronaut must wait for the confirmation
before proceeding. But the astronaut also knows the confirmation will come /eventually/. They can
continue to the next dish before receiving the confirmation if they are confident that doing so
still guarantees that the next installation will not happen before the ground is ready. Another way
of looking at it is that the astronaut knows ground confirmed the installation, but the
communication saying as much was delayed. The challenge then is to wait as little time as necessary
before moving on to the next dish. To decide when to act, the astronaut relies on advice from the
delay scheduler built in to their digital assistant.

Broadly speaking in this scenario, we have two types of inputs and one type of output. The first
input is decided before the astronaut egresses the habitat. MCC writes an EVA timeline, which
describes the events that need to take place and the relationship between events, such as their
ordering, the time between them, or how much delay there may be between when an event occurs and
when it is observed. Once the astronaut starts the EVA, we have a second input, which is the time
when events are observed. Taken together, we are tasked with finding an output of deciding which
future events should be executed at what time.

We use temporal networks [cite:@Dechter1991] to model EVA timelines as constraints (relationships)
between a finite set of events. Some events may have associated uncertain observation delay. Let a
temporal network be represented by $S$, with events $X$, and uncertain observation delay
$\gammabar$.

At some time $t$ during an EVA, we have a set of events that were /observed/ before $t$, $\obs(x <
t)$. When an event has been recorded at a given time $t$, we say that it has been /assigned/. The
set of events that were assigned a time before $t$ is $\assign(x < t)$. If there is no associated
observation delay with an event $x_{c}$, then $\obs(x_{c}) = \assign(x_{c})$. If there is associated
observation delay, then it is possible that $\obs(x_{c}) < \assign(x_{c})$.

We want a /Real-Time Execution Decision/ (RTED), which consists of unexecuted events and when they
should be performed. Each RTED is a tuple of a set of unexecuted events, $x_{u} \subseteq X$ and
future time, $t'$, $\langle x_{u}, t' \rangle$.

Our specific problem statement for the delay scheduler is as follows. The delay scheduler should
take 6-tuple $\langle S, X, \gammabar, \obs(x < t), \assign(x < t) \rangle$ of the offline and online
components of scheduling as input and output an RTED $\langle x_{u}, t' \rangle$.

We can expand the scenario from above to include multiple astronauts installing multiple satellite
dishes in parallel. MCC wants to minimize the number of dishes that are being confirmed at any given
moment, so we add a new constraint that dictates that, given astronauts 1 and 2, astronaut 2 may not
start installing a dish until they receive confirmation that astronaut 1 is complete. Likewise,
astronaut 3 must wait for 2 to finish their confirmation, 4 must wait for 3, and so on in a round
robin fashion. Like communication with MCC, communications between astronauts is spotty (hence why
they need to install communication infrastructure!) Sometimes, astronauts may easily communicate,
other times communications may be significantly delayed or drop out altogether.

Naturally, the astronauts must be able to share events with each other. We expand the previous
problem statement to the multi-agent case by adding the notion of agents, $A$. Each agent has their
own $S$ with a subset of events, $x \subset X$, they expect to receive from their peers in the form
of observations or communications. From the perspective of an agent, $a \in A$, at time $t$, their
peers simply need to be aware of what events $a$ has assigned, $\assign_{a}(x < t)$. Events that $a$
receives from peers are no different than observations.

Thus, the multi-agent addition to the problem statement is as follows. Given tuple $\langle
\assign(x_{t}), A$, all assignments $\assign_{a}(x < t)$ should be communicated to all agents $a \in
A$.

** Approach

The interface of the delay scheduler is designed around the notion of taking everything we know
about set of temporal constraints and when events have been assigned and distilling it down to a
single RTED. There are three key processes in the delay scheduler.

1. an offline process that prepares the scheduler with a given $S$,
2. an online process that records event assignments and shares them with peers, and
3. an online process that generates RTEDs when the scheduler is queried.

** Modeling Temporal Constraints with Uncertain Observations


** Scheduling Events with Uncertain Observations


** An Envisioned Executive for Dispatching Actions with Uncertain Observations


** Multi-Agent Scheduling with Uncertain Observations





1. Defining and implementing an execution strategy that is applicable to all outcomes of uncertainty
   when there is variable observation delay.
2. Enacting online, multi-agent coordination through communication.

We take the view that the coordination of multiple agents with observation uncertainty requires that
each agent must act independently without any assumption of a centralized authority dispatching
plans. The first gap effectively defines a single-agent architecture that is useful in its own right
for online scheduling in the face of observation delay. To do so, we build off existing temporal
reasoning procedures for checking the controllability of temporal constraints to include uncertain
observations of events. This procedure naturally informs the design of an execution strategy, or
scheduling algorithm, for deciding when an agent should act given their knowledge of the history of
events that have been scheduled so far. The second gap allows independent scheduling agents to
coordinate their actions through communications, even when those communications may have uncertain
delay. The result is a multi-agent execution architecture that is greater than the sum of its parts.

** Summary of Contributions

Here we present the specific contributions of this thesis that are required to address the gaps
presented above.

+ Safe Execution Strategy for Temporal Networks with Uncertain Observation Delay :: Past work on the
  study of temporal networks with variable observation delay has provided a sound and complete
  method for proving the controllability given a set of constraints and uncertain observation delay
  [cite:@Bhargava2018]. We contribute an execution strategy that builds off the controllability
  checker and is valid for all resolutions of uncertainty realized during execution.
+ An Online Scheduler for Temporal Networks with Uncertain Observation Delay :: Past work in
  temporal reasoning has provided a sound and complete online algorithm for dispatching controllable
  events given all other event assignments up to the current time [cite:@Hunsberger2016]. We
  contribute an extension to online scheduling that implements the execution strategy for uncertain
  observation delay.
+ An Online Dispatcher for Dispatching Events to Hardware :: State of the art schedulers are limited
  in that they output execution decisions, which act like instructions as to when to act rather than
  actions themselves [cite:@Hunsberger2016]. We contribute a dispatching algorithm for enacting
  execution decisions on robotic hardware in the face of uncertain observations.
+ Distributed, Multi-Agent Coordination through Uncertain Communications :: We contribute a
  coordination algorithm that allows multiple agents, each using the scheduling and dispatching
  contributions described above, to share knowledge of event observations. The result is a framework
  that enables safe scheduling and dispatching events when there are inter-agent constraints with
  uncertain communication.

** Thesis Structure

The structure of this thesis is as follows. A more detailed problem statement, including
descriptions of the scenarios used for testing distributed collaboration and coordination with
uncertain communication, will be provided in Chapter [[ch:problem-statement]]. Our approach to
addressing the problem statement will be outlined in Chapter [[ch:approach]]. Chapter [[ch:modeling-tn]]
will provide the first technical contributions of this thesis, first by addressing the issue of
modeling observation delay, then by providing a procedure that can be used to guarantee that
temporal constraints with observation delay are satisfiable. Chapter [[ch:delay-scheduling]] expands
existing algorithms for deciding when to act given the resolution of constraints. There, we
contribute a novel strategy for deciding when to act given observation delay. Additionally, we
formalize and separate often confused components of scheduling, allowing us to design a more robust
task scheduling executive that can be deployed to real hardware. Chapter [[ch:technical-coordination]]
finally contributes a multi-agent coordination architecture for environments with uncertain
communication. The discussion in Chapter [[ch:discussion]] concludes this thesis by providing additional
context for the decisions made during this research.
