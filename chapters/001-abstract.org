As space exploration accelerates, we must develop a robust framework for multi-agent coordination in
order to safely operate in space and on planetary surfaces, which are inherently hostile to
communication. To the best of our knowledge, there are no autonomous executives capable of
coordinating with other agents while reasoning over communication delay to decide when to act.
Existing research has provided insights into
