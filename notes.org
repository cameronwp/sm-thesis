#+title: Notes

* TODO "communication uncertainty" vs "observation uncertainty" vs "observation delay"
We should be consistent. At the very least, include a note somewhere towards the beginning that the

* TODO need more flexibility in referring to control programs in RMPL
comment on this in discussion
* TODO controllable vs free vs requirement; contingent vs uncontrollable
Need to be more consistent / or just explain the (lack of) diff somewhere
