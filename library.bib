  abstract = {This document establishes the integrated set of Exploration Objectives for all exploration activities in the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). The purpose of the Exploration Objectives is to translate and bridge the gap between agency-level human exploration goals as articulated in NASA's Strategic Plan and other programmatic documentation into clear and discrete objectives for implementation by HEOMD organizations and HEOMD-led missions. The Exploration Objectives can also be used to help inform, identify, and/or prioritize agency technology and science investments. The Exploration Objectives are intended to be dynamic, and will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in agency strategy, improving scientific and technical knowledge, accumulated operational experience, availability of resources, and/or programmatic lessons learned. As HEOMD and other executing organizations evolve, and as relevant HEOMD constituent organizational plans and mission products such as Mission Objectives (MOs) are created or updated in the normal course of business, those plans and products shall align to the Exploration Objectives. The HEOMD Exploration Objectives will inform, and be driven by, future updates to the NASA Strategic Plan. While not explicitly stated in the exploration objectives listed in this document, the health and safety of crew is implicit in all of the HEOMD objectives. The objectives for exploration phases beyond the Earth-Moon system (see Section 4) are not defined in this document. However, this is not intended to preclude investment by HEOMD or stakeholder organizations in planned missions and early-stage technology activities with potential relevance for crewed missions beyond the Earth-Moon system. This strategy allows NASA the opportunity to remain agile and to continue to refine its plans over time while maintaining the focus on exploration of the martian surface as the horizon goal. NASA's planning will continue to be informed by advances in technology and scientific knowledge, as well as by opportunities presented by growing government/commercial capabilities and international participation. The exploration objectives contained herein are intended to inform program requirements and revisions as necessary.},

Observations and modeling have suggested that 24 Themis is the core of an icy asteroid, and the Themis family likely represents the fragments of an icy protoplanet broken apart by Nature's rock hammer. In this white paper, we identify key questions in planetary science, earth science, and astrobiology, that would be addressed by further study of the interior evolution of icy asteroids such as 24 Themis. We present possible measurements and potential future research focused on the Themis family in the next decade. While much can still be done telescopically and in the laboratory, a spacecraft mission would be necessary to make key measurements that address origin and ice-rock fractionation science objectives for 24 Themis and family members.},

Seventy-one subjects completed two field tests: a physical abilities test and a 10. km Walkback test. The relationships between test times and the following parameters were determined: running V\textperiodcentered O2max, gas exchange threshold (GET), speed at V\textperiodcentered O2max (s-V\textperiodcentered O2max), highest sustainable rate of aerobic metabolism [critical speed (CS)], and the finite distance that could be covered above CS (D'): arm cranking V\textperiodcentered O2peak, GET, critical power (CP), and the finite work that can be performed above CP (W'). CS, running V\textperiodcentered O2max, s-V\textperiodcentered O2max, and arm cranking V\textperiodcentered O2peak had the highest correlations with the physical abilities field test (r = 0.66-0.82, P{$<$}. 0.001). For the 10. km Walkback, CS, s-V\textperiodcentered O2max, and running V\textperiodcentered O2max were significant predictors (r = 0.64-0.85, P{$<$}. 0.001). CS and to a lesser extent V\textperiodcentered O2max are most strongly associated with tasks that simulate aspects of EVA performance, highlighting CS as a method for evaluating astronaut physical capacity.},

The models considered are multilayer perceptron, Bayesian neural networks, radial basis functions, generalized regression neural networks (also called kernel regression), K-nearest neighbor regression, CART regression trees, support vector regression, and Gaussian processes. The study reveals significant differences between the different methods. The best two methods turned out to be the multilayer perceptron and the Gaussian process regression. In addition to model comparisons, we have tested different preprocessing methods and have shown that they have different impacts on the performance.},

In this work, we investigate the problem of covering an unknown connected grid environment (e.g. a maze or connected corridors) with a robotic swarm so as to minimize the maximal number of steps that each member of the swarm makes and their activity time before their work is finished, thereby minimizing the energy requirements. The robots are autonomous, anonymous and identical, with local sensors and finite memory, and possess no communication capabilities. They are assumed to disperse over time from a fixed location, and to move synchronously. The robots are tasked with occupying every cell of the environment, while avoiding collisions. In the literature such topics are known as \textbackslash textit\{uniform dispersal problems\}. The goal of minimizing the number of steps traveled by the robots has previously been studied in this context. Our contribution is a local robotic strategy for simply connected grid environments that, by exploiting their topology, achieves optimal makespan (the amount of time it takes to cover the environment) and minimizes the maximal number of steps taken by the individual robots before their deactivation. The robots succeed in discovering optimal paths to their eventual destinations, and finish the covering process in \$2V-1\$ time steps, where \$V\$ is the number of cells in the environment.},

  abstract = {Extravehicular Activity (EVA) is a critical component of human spaceflight, but working in gas-pressurized space suits causes fatigue, excessive energy expenditure, and injury. Relatively little is known about how the astronaut moves and interacts with the space suit, and what factors lead to injury. A wearable pressure sensing system to quantitatively measure areas on the body's surface that the space suit impacts during dynamic EVA movement is developed. The system is used to characterize human-suit interaction in the NASA Mark III space suit. Three experienced subjects perform a series of upper body movements: 3 isolated joint movements and 2 functional tasks. Movements are repeated 12 times each and in-suit pressure responses are evaluated both by quantifying peak pressure and full profile responses. Results Sequential sensor activation allows subjects to be indexed inside the space suit during complicated motions to better understand suited biomechanics. Subjectively, subjects generally feel they are consistent for all movements. However, using a nonparametric H-test, 54\% of movements are found to be biomechanically inconsistent (p{$<$}0.05). This experiment provides the first "window" inside the space suit to evaluate contact pressures and sequential indexing of the person inside the suit for realistic EVA movement. It cannot be extrapolated how changes in contact pressure would affect a subject's propensity for injury as injuries accumulate over long time scales. However, changes in pressure may be due to alterations in biomechanical strategies or fatigue, both of which could be precursors for injury and discomfort.},

  abstract = {America has entered a new era of exploration. NASA's Artemis program will lead humanity forward to the Moon and prepare us for the next giant leap, the exploration of Mars. It has been almost 50 years since astronauts last walked on the lunar surface during the Apollo program, and since then the robotic exploration of deep space has seen decades of technological advancement and scientific discoveries. For the last 20 years, humans have continuously lived and worked aboard the International Space Station 250 miles above Earth, preparing for the day we move farther into the solar system. Sending human explorers 250,000 miles to the Moon, then 140 million miles to Mars, requires a bold vision, effective program management, funding for modern systems development and mission operations, and support from all corners of our great nation as well as our partners across the globe. NASA has been fine-tuning the plan to achieve that bold vision since the president called on the agency in December 2017 to lead a human return to the Moon and beyond with commercial and international partners. Two years later, he challenged us yet again, this time to send the first woman and next man to the Moon within five years. NASA is implementing the Artemis program to achieve those goals, and this document lays out the agency's Moon to Mars exploration approach explaining how we will do it. The Moon plan is twofold: it's focused on achieving the goal of an initial human landing by 2024 with acceptable technical risks, while simultaneously working toward sustainable lunar exploration in the mid- to late 2020s. 2024 is not an arbitrary date. It is the most ambitious date possible, and our success at the Moon, and later, at Mars, will be grounded in our national goals and robust capabilities. The United States leads in space exploration now; however, as more countries and companies take aim at the Moon, America needs the earliest possible landing to maintain and build on that leadership, as well as to prepare for a historic first human mission to Mars. Landing astronauts on the Moon within four years will better focus this global initiative on the engineering, technology development, and process improvements necessary to safely and successfully carry out sustained human exploration of the Moon. It also paves the way for U.S. commercial companies and international partners to further contribute to the exploration and development of the Moon. We need several years in orbit and on the surface of the Moon to build operational confidence for conducting long-term work and supporting life away from Earth before we can embark on the first multi-year human mission to Mars. The sooner we get to the Moon, the sooner we get American astronauts to Mars.We need to act fast to make this vision a reality, and a crewed lunar landing by 2024 is the key to a successful Moon to Mars exploration approach. Our next lunar landing paves the way for a new and sustainable lunar economy\textemdash one where U.S. companies and international partners will benefit from and build on what we learn.},

  abstract = {Curiosity landed on plains to the north of Mount Sharp in August 2012. By June 2016 the rover had traversed 12.9 km to the southwest, encountering extensive strata that were deposited in a fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine system. Initial drives across sharp sandstone outcrops initiated an unacceptably high rate of punctures and cracks in the thin aluminum wheel skin structures. Initial damage was found to be related to the drive control mode of the six wheel drive actuators and the kinematics of the rocker-bogie suspension. Wheels leading a suspension pivot were forced onto sharp, immobile surfaces by the other wheels as they maintained their commanded angular velocities. Wheel damage mechanisms such as geometry-induced stress concentration cracking and low-cycle fatigue were then exacerbated. A geomorphic map was generated to assist in planning traverses that would minimize further wheel damage. A steady increase in punctures and cracks between landing and June 2016 was due in part because of drives across the sharp sandstone outcrops that could not be avoided. Wheel lifetime estimates show that with careful path planning the wheels will be operational for an additional ten kilometers or more, allowing the rover to reach key strata exposed on the slopes of Mount Sharp.},

A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

  abstract = {In autonomous exploration a mobile agent must adapt to new measurements to seek high reward, but disturbances cause a probability of collision that must be traded off against expected reward. This paper considers an autonomous agent tasked with maximizing measurements from a Gaussian Process while subject to unbounded disturbances. We seek an adaptive policy in which the maximum allowed probability of failure is constrained as a function of the expected reward. The policy is found using an extension to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which bounds probability of failure. We apply MCTS to a sequence of approximating problems, which allows constraint satisfying actions to be found in an anytime manner. Our innovation lies in defining the approximating problems and replanning strategy such that the probability of failure constraint is guaranteed to be satisfied over the true policy. The approach does not need to plan for all measurements explicitly or constrain planning based only on the measurements that were observed. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to enforce probability of failure constraints in adaptive sampling. Through experiments on real bathymetric data and simulated measurements, we show our algorithm allows an agent to take dangerous actions only when the reward justifies the risk. We then verify through Monte Carlo simulations that failure bounds are satisfied.},

Although all of them honor roughly the same hybrid systems semantics, they have drastically different model description languages. This situation (a) makes it difficult to quickly evaluate a specific hybrid automaton model using the different tools, (b) obstructs comparisons of reachability approaches, and (c) impedes the widespread application of research results that perform model modification and could benefit many of the tools. In this paper, we present Hyst, a Hybrid Source Transformer. Hyst is a source-to-source translation tool, currently taking input in the SpaceEx model format, and translating to the formats of HyCreate, Flow{${_\ast}$}, or dReach. Internally, the tool supports generic model-to-model transformation passes that serve to both ease the translation and potentially improve reachability results for the supported tools. Although these model transformation passes could be implemented within each tool, the Hyst approach provides a single place for model modification, generating modified input sources for the unmodified target tools. Our evaluation demonstrates Hyst is capable of automatically translating benchmarks in several classes (including affine and nonlinear hybrid automata) to the input formats of several tools. Additionally, we illustrate a general model transformation pass based on pseudo-invariants implemented in Hyst that illustrates the reachability improvement.},

While useful for evaluation and debugging, such analysis is often incomplete owing to the nondeterminism in the discrete transitions and the uncountability of the continuous space. In this paper, we present a precise notion of simulations for CPS called simulation-equivalent reachability, which includes all the states that can be reached by any simulation. While this notion is weaker than traditional reachability, we present a technique that performs simulation-equivalent reachability in an efficient, scalable, and theoretically sound and complete manner. For achieving this, we describe two improvements, namely invariant constraint propagation for handling invariants and on-demand successor deaggregation for handling discrete transitions. We use our tool implementation of the approach, HyLAA (Hybrid Linear Automata Analyzer), to evaluate the improvements, and demonstrate computing the simulation-equivalent reachable set for a replicated helicopter systems with over 1000 dimensions in about 10 min.},

We enhance the Tableau SAT algorithm of Crawford and Auton with look-back techniques and evaluate its performance on problems specifically designed to challenge it. The Random 3-SAT problem space has commonly been used to benchmark SAT algorithms because consistently difficult instances can be found near a region known as the phase transition. We modify Random 3-SAT in two ways which make instances even harder. First, we evaluate problems with structural regularities and find that CSP look-back techniques offer little advantage. Second, we evaluate problems in which a hard unsatisfiable instance of medium size is embedded in a larger instance, and we find the look-back enhancements to be indispensable. Without them, most instances are "exceptionally hard" -orders of magnitude harder than typical Random 3-SAT instances with the same surface characteristics.},

Levels of robot autonomy (LORA), ranging from teleoperation to fully autonomous systems, influence the way in which humans and robots interact with one another. Thus, there is a need to understand HRI by identifying variables that influence\textemdash and are influenced by\textemdash robot autonomy. Our overarching goal is to develop a framework for LORA in HRI. To reach this goal, our framework draws links between HRI and human-automation interaction, a field with a long history of studying and understanding human-related variables. The construct of autonomy is reviewed and redefined within the context of HRI. Additionally, this framework proposes a process for determining a robot's autonomy level by categorizing autonomy along a 10-point taxonomy. The framework is intended to be treated as a guideline for determining autonomy, categorizing the LORA along a qualitative taxonomy and considering HRI variables (e.g., acceptance, situation awareness, reliability) that may be influenced by the LORA Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable \{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0in; mso-para-margin-right:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0in; line-height:115\%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\}},

These include local movement patterns corresponding to the current and preferred velocities and global characteristics such as entry points and movement features. Our approach involves no precomputation and we demonstrate the real-time performance of our prediction algorithm on sparse and noisy trajectory data extracted from dense indoor and outdoor crowd videos. The combination of local and global movement patterns can improve the accuracy of long-term prediction by 12-18\% over prior methods in high-density videos.},

Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. 3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design-a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

These scheduling problems become more difficult when the duration of certain actions are outside the agent's control. Delay controllability is the generalized notion of whether a schedule can be constructed in the face of uncertainty if the agent eventually learns when events occur. Our work introduces the substantially more complex setting of determining variable-delay controllability, where an agent learns about events after some unknown but bounded amount of time has passed. We provide an efficient O(n3) variable-delay controllability checker and show how to create an execution strategy for variable-delay controllability problems. To our knowledge, these essential capabilities are absent from existing controllability checking algorithms. We conclude by providing empirical evaluations of the quality of variable-delay controllability results as compared to approximations that use fixed delays to model the same problems.},

To determine whether we can construct a schedule for a given network, we typically consider one of two types of controllability: dynamic or strong. These controllability checks have strict conditions on how uncertainty is resolved; uncertain outcomes are either recognized immediately or not at all. In this paper, we introduce delay controllability, a novel generalization of both strong and dynamic controllability that additionally exposes a large range of controllability classes in between. To do so, we use a delay function to parameterize our controllability checking. This delay function represents the difference between when an event happens and the time that it is observed. We also provide a single unified algorithm for checking delay controllability that runs in O(n\^3) time, matching the best known runtime for dynamic controllability, which we use to motivate the decision to generalize dynamic and strong controllability. We conclude by providing an empirical evaluation of delay controllability, demonstrating its superior accuracy and practical efficiency as compared to other existing approximations.},

However, agents often have flexibility in choosing when to communicate the results of their action. In this paper, we address the question of how to choose communication protocols that guarantee the feasibility of the original temporal plan subject to some cost associated with that communication. To do so, we introduce a means of extracting delay controllability conflicts and show how we can use these conflicts to more efficiently guide our search. We then present three conflict-directed search algorithms and explore the theoretical and empirical trade-offs between the different approaches.},

Our work improves the runtime of checking the dynamic controllability of STNUs with integer bounds to O (min(mn, mn log N) + km + k2n + kn log n). Our approach pre-processes the STNU using an existing O(n3) dynamic controllability checking algorithm and provides tighter bounds on its runtime.

  number = {2000},
  abstract = {In this thesis, we present a theory for constructing real-time executives that can rea- son about communication between agents. In multi-agent coordination problems, different agents have different beliefs about the state of the world that can eventually be reconciled if the agents are able to share sufficient information with one another. When communication is limited, this task becomes more difficult. To achieve robust- ness, coordination decisions need to be made, executed, and adapted in real-time by a real-time executive. Most existing real-time executives rely on perfect knowledge of the state of the world, making it difficult to use them in scenarios where agents either cannot or prefer not to communicate and share information. This thesis offers three contributions that together provide the basis for constructing a real-time executive capable of handling multi-agent coordination under limited communication. First, we introduce delay controllability as a way to augment the input plan rep- resentation to including a communication model. Delay controllability lets us reason about multi-agent activities under limited communication in the form of communica- tion delays and provides a guarantee that problem evaluation is tractable. Second, we provide a way to indicate by when each agent must communicate the results of their actions. Many agents have flexibility in choosing exactly when to communicate. We provide an algorithm for choosing a low-cost set of moments to communicate and present a strategy for adjusting those strategies when commu- nication networks are unreliable causing disruptions in the original communication plan. Third, we offer a way to model noisy communication. Noisy communication offers approximate temporal information that is useful during execution but is generally difficult to incorporate. We introduce variable-delay controllability as a way to model this kind of communication and provide the first sound and complete algorithm for incorporating noisy information that runs in polynomial time},

We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burdensome computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles need to plan trajectories to a specified goal that avoid obstacles. Previous approaches that used a constrained optimization approach to solve for unite sequences of optimal control inputs have been highly effective. For robust execution, it is essential to take into account the inherent uncertainty in the problem, which arises due to uncertain localization, modeling errors, and disturbances. Prior work has handled the case of deterministically bounded uncertainty. We present here an alternative approach that uses a probabilistic representation of uncertainty, and plans the future probabilistic distribution of the vehicle state so that the probability of collision with obstacles is below a specified threshold. This approach has two main advantages; first, uncertainty is often modeled more naturally using a probabilistic representation (for example in the case of uncertain localization); second, by specifying the probability of successful execution, the desired level of conservatism in the plan can be specified in a meaningful manner. The key idea behind the approach is that the probabilistic obstacle avoidance problem can be expressed as a Disjunctive Linear Program using linear chance constraints. The resulting Disjunctive Linear Program has the same complexity as that corresponding to the deterministic path planning problem with no representation of uncertainty. Hence the resulting problem can be solved using existing, efficient techniques, such that planning with uncertainty requires minimal additional computation. Finally, we present an empirical validation of the new method with a number of aircraft obstacle avoidance scenarios. \textcopyright{} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Many applications of autonomous agents require groups to work in tight coordination. To be dependable, these groups must plan, carry out and adapt their activities in a way that is robust to failure and to uncertainty. Previous work developed contingent, temporally flexible plans. These plans provide robustness to uncertain activity durations, through flexible timing constraints, and robustness to plan failure, through alternate approaches to achieving a task. Robust execution of contingent, temporally flexible plans consists of two phases. First, in the plan extraction phase, the executive chooses between the functionally redundant methods in the plan to select an execution sequence that satisfies the temporal bounds in the plan. Second, in the plan execution phase, the executive dispatches the plan, using the temporal flexibility to schedule activities dynamically.},

We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We address the critical challenge of reasoning over individuals' interacting schedules to efficiently answer queries about how to meet scheduling goals while respecting individual privacy and autonomy to the extent possible. We formally define the Multiagent Simple Temporal Problem for naturally capturing and reasoning over the distributed but interconnected scheduling problems of multiple individuals. Our hypothesis is that combining bottom-up and top-down approaches will lead to effective solution techniques. In our bottom-up phase, an agent externalizes constraints that compactly summarize how its local subproblem affects other agents' subproblems, whereas in our top-down phase an agent proactively constructs and internalizes new local constraints that decouple its subproblem from others'. We confirm this hypothesis by devising distributed algorithms that calculate summaries of the joint solution space for multiagent scheduling problems, without centralizing or otherwise redistributing the problems. The distributed algorithms permit concurrent execution to achieve significant speedup over the current art and also increase the level of privacy and independence in individual agent reasoning. These algorithms are most advantageous for problems where interactions between the agents are sparse compared to the complexity of agents' individual problems.},

From an abstract point of view, hybrid planning domains are based on hybrid automata, which have been studied intensively in the model checking community. In particular, powerful model checking algorithms and tools have emerged for this formalism. However, despite the quest for more scalable planning approaches, model checking algorithms have not been applied to planning in hybrid domains so far. In this paper, we make a first step in bridging the gap between these two worlds. We provide a formal translation scheme from PDDL+ to the standard formalism of hybrid automata, as a solid basis for using hybrid system modelchecking tools for dealing with hybrid planning domains. As a case study, we use the SpaceEx model checker, showing how we can address PDDL+ domains that are out of the scope of state-of-the-art planners.},

Fortunately, a polynomial translation is possible by first introducing definitions, one for each subformula of the conjecture. This exhaustiveness can however be proved inefficient when the length of proofs is considered. In order to improve this interesting technique, we first generalize it to renamings, which consist in introducing definitions only for a subset of subformulas, resulting in a wide set of possible clause forms from a single conjecture. We show how a simple and efficient algorithm yields a renaming which, on equivalence-free conjectures, minimizes the number of clauses among these clause forms. This translation has been tested on the famous challenge problem by P. Andrews, yielding a spectacular reduction in search space and time, and therefore is one of the more simple and general technique to efficiently produce a resolution proof for this problem. \textcopyright{} 1992.},

We first consider Weak Controllability. We present two sound and complete algorithms for checking Weak Controllability of DTPUs. The first algorithm needs to examine only a limited number of scenarios, but operates only on a restricted class of problems. The second algorithm is fully general, but is more expensive in terms of space. We then consider Dynamic Controllability. We present a complete algorithm for testing this property for TCSPUs.

The underlying assumption behind the HBSS approach is that strictly adhering to a search heuris-tic often does not yield the best solution and, there-fore, exploration off the heuristic path can prove fruit-ful. Within the HBSS approach, the balance between heuristic adherence and exploration can be controlled according to the confidence one has in the heuristic. By varying this balance, encoded as a bias function, the HBSS approach encompasses a family of search al-gorithms of which greedy search and completely ran-dom search are extreme members. We present empir-ical results from an application of HBSS to the real-world problem of observation scheduling. These re-sults show that with the proper bias function, it can be easy to outperform greedy search.},

We are using the NASA Resource Prospector mission as a reference mission in our research. The primary objective of this mission is to assess the feasibility of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) on the lunar surface. One of the mission operations constraints is that the rover is generally required to avoid being in shadow, because it is solar-powered. This requirement depends on where the rover is located and when it is at that location. Such a temporal-spatial constraint makes traverse planning more challenging for both humans and machines. We present a mixed-initiative traverse planner which helps address this challenge. This traverse planner is part of the Exploration Ground Data Systems (xGDS), which we have enhanced with new visualization features, new analysis tools, and new automation for path planning, in order to be applicable to the Resource Prospector mission. The key concept that is the basis of the analysis tools and that supports the automated path planning is reachability in this dynamic environment due to the temporal-spatial constraints.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from 3 years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections, where anyone can publish anything they want. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mental stress reduces performances, on the work place and in daily life, and is one of the first causes of cognitive dysfunctions, cardiovascular disorders and depression. This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},

  author = {Chakraborti, Tathagata and Sreedharan, Sarath and Kambhampati, Subbarao},
  year = {2018},
  journal = {ICAPS Workshop on Explainable AI Planning (XAIP)},
  abstract = {Human-aware planning requires an agent to be aware of the mental model of the humans, in addition to their physical or capability model. This not only allows an agent to envisage the desired roles of the human in a joint plan but also anticipate how its plan will be perceived by the latter. The human mental model becomes especially useful in the context of an explainable planning (XAIP) agent since an explanatory process cannot be a soliloquy, i.e. it must incorporate the hu-man's beliefs and expectations of the planner. In this paper, we survey our recent efforts in this direction. Cognitive AI teaming (Chakraborti et al. 2017a) requires a planner to perform argumentation over a set of models during the plan generation process. This is illustrated in Figure 1. Here, M R is the model of the agent embodying the planner (e.g. a robot), and M H is the model of the human in the loop. Further, M R h is the model the human thinks the robot has, and M H r is the model that the robot thinks the human has. Finally, \texttildelow{} M R h is the robot's approximation of M R h ; for the rest of the paper we will be using M R h to refer to both since, for all intents and purposes, this is all the robot has access to. Note that the human mental model M R h is in addition to the (robot's belief of the) human model M H r traditionally encountered in human-robot teaming (HRT) settings and is, in essence, the fundamental thesis of the recent works on plan explanations (Chakraborti et al. 2017b) and explicable planning (Zhang et al. 2017). The need for expli-cable planning or plan explanations occurs when the models-M R and M R h-diverge so that the optimal plans in the respective models may not be the same and hence optimal behavior of the robot in its own model is inexplicable to the human. This is also true for discrepancies between M H and M H r when the robot might reveal unrealistic expectations of the human in a joint plan. An explainable planning (XAIP) agent (Fox et al. 2017; Langley et al. 2017; Weld and Bansal 2018) should be able to able to deal with such model differences and participate in explanatory dialog with the human such that both of them can be on the same page during a collaborative activity. This is referred to as model reconciliation (Chakraborti et al. 2017b) and forms the core of the explanatory process of an XAIP agent. In this paper, we look at the scope of problems engendered by this multi-model setting and describe Figure 1: Argumentation over multiple models during the deliberative process of a human-aware planner (e.g. robot). the recent work in this direction. Specifically-We outline the scope of behaviors engendered by human-aware planning, including joint planning as studied in teaming using the human model, as well as explicable planning with the human mental model;-We situate the plan explanation problem in the context of perceived inexplicability of the robot's plans or behaviors due to differences in these models;-We discuss how the plan explanation process can be seen as one of model reconciliation where M R h (and/or M H r) is brought closer to M R (M H);-We discuss how explicability and explanation costs can be traded off during plan generation;-We discuss how this process can be adapted to handle uncertainty or multiple humans in the loop;-We discuss results of a user study that testify to the usefulness of the model reconciliation process;-We point to ongoing work in the space of abstractions and deception using the human mental model.},

A ``grasping energy function,'' E is introduced that which is proportional to the distance between two grasping points. The antipodal points correspond to critical points of E in T. Optimization and/or continuation techniques are used to find these critical points. In particular, global optimization techniques are applied to find the ``maximal'' or ``minimal'' grasp.

We address this problem by finding a piecewise linear path for each agent such that the actual trajectories following these paths are guaranteed to satisfy the reach-and-avoid requirement. We show that the spatial tracking error of the actual trajectories of the controlled agents can be precomputed for any qualified path that considers the minimum duration of each path segment due to actuation limits. Using these bounds, we find a collision-free path for each agent by solving Mixed Integer-Linear Programs and coordinate agents by using the priority-based search. We demonstrate our method by benchmarking in 2D and 3D scenarios with ground vehicles and quadrotors, respectively, and show improvements over the solving time and the solution quality compared to two state-of-the-art multi-agent motion planners.},

  abstract = {In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time-scales rang-ing from real-time operation to long-term plan-ning. This process often involves solving sim-ilar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under stringent time requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this solution process to directly learn the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need of solving computationally expensive large-scale paramet-ric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active con-straints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables more interpretable learning poli-cies, and inherently accounts for relevant safety constraints. Further, the number of relevant ac-tive sets is finite, which make them simpler ob-jects to learn. To learn the relevant active sets, we propose a streaming algorithm backed up by the-oretical results. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks of the Optimal Power Flow prob-lem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that this is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning al-gorithm to target.},

Priority-based decoupled approach is one of the several approaches to solve a MAPP problem. It works as follows: first, find paths of individual agents and then restructure these paths based on some priority of the agents. Most of the existing decoupled approaches use centralised algorithms. However, multi-agent systems are inherently distributed, where agents have limited information and each agent may not know the total number of agents in the system. Some of these aspects are incorporated in DMAPP. DMAPP is an existing fully distributed algorithm that works in three phases: (i) individual path planning, (ii) priority decision-making and (iii) plan restructuring. However, DMAPP is incomplete, i.e. DMAPP may fail to find a solution, even if it exists. In this paper, we present a new distributed algorithm (DiMPP) which is complete. The computer simulations performed on some well-known benchmark domains reveal that DiMPP outperforms DMAPP in the number of problem instances solved. For larger problem instances, the time taken by DiMPP is orders of magnitude less than that of some existing centralised algorithms.},

Contrarily, model-based systems eliminate the need to manually generate the rules.

Julia's subtyping algorithm is surprisingly complex, and determining whether it is correct remains an open question. In this paper, we focus on one piece of this problem: the interaction between union types and covariant tuples. Previous work normalized unions inside tuples to disjunctive normal form. However, this strategy has two drawbacks: complex type signatures induce space explosion, and interference between normalization and other features of Julia's type system. In this paper, we describe the algorithm that Julia uses to compute subtyping between tuples and unions \textendash{} an algorithm that is immune to space explosion and plays well with other features of the language.

A TP with uncertainty (TPU) is characterized by activities with uncontrollable duration. Different classes of TPU are possible, depending on the Boolean structure of the constraints: we have simple (STPU), constraint satisfaction (TCSPU), and disjunctive (DTPU) temporal problems with uncertainty. In this paper we tackle the problem of strong controllability, i.e. finding an assignment to all the controllable time points, such that the constraints are fulfilled under any possible assignment of uncontrollable time points. Our approach casts the problem in the framework of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT), where the uncertainty of durations can be modeled by means of universal quantifiers. The use of quantifier elimination techniques leads to quantifier-free encodings, which are in turn solved with efficient SMT solvers. We obtain the first practical and comprehensive solution for strong controllability. We provide a family of efficient encodings, that are able to exploit the specific structure of the problem. The approach has been implemented, and experimentally evaluated over a large set of benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach is feasible, and outperforms the best state-of-the-art competitors, when available.},

MathSAT5 is the latest version of the tool. It supports most of the SMT-LIB theories and their combinations, and provides many functionalities (like e.g. unsat cores, interpolation, AllSMT). MathSAT5 improves its predecessor MathSAT4 in many ways, also providing novel features: first, a much improved incrementality support, which is vital in SMT applications; second, a full support for the theories of arrays and floating point; third, sound SAT-style Boolean formula preprocessing for SMT formulae; finally, a framework allowing users for plugging their custom tuned SAT solvers. MathSAT5 is freely available, and it is used in numerous internal projects, as well as by a number of industrial partners. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Temporal networks are data structures for representing and reasoning about temporal constraints on activities. Many kinds of temporal networks have been defined in the literature, differing in their expressiveness. The simplest kinds of networks have polynomial algorithms for determining their consistency or controllability, but corresponding algorithms for more expressive networks (e.g., Those that include observation nodes or disjunctive constraints) have so far been unavailable. However, recent work has introduced a new approach to such algorithms based on translating temporal networks into Timed Game Automata (TGAs) and then using off-the-shelf software to synthesize execution strategies - or determine that none exist. So far, that approach has only been used on Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty, for which polynomial algorithms already exist. This paper extends the temporal-network-to-TGA approach to accommodate observation nodes and disjunctive constraints. Insodoing the paper presents, for the first time, sound and complete algorithms for checking the dynamic controllability of these more expressive networks. The translations also highlight the theoretical relationships between various kinds of temporal networks and the TGA model. The new algorithms have immediate applications in the workflow models being developed to automate business processes, including in the health-care domain.},

This paper provides a novel mapping from STNUs to Timed Game Automata (TGAs) that: (1) explicates the deep theoretical relationships between STNUs and TGAs; and (2) enables the memoryless strategies generated from the TGA to be transformed into equivalent STNU execution strategies that reduce the real-time computational burden for the executor.

In this work, we focus on the most general class of TPU, namely disjunctive TPU (DTPU), and consider the case of weak controllability, that allows one to model problems arising in practical scenarios (e.g. on-line scheduling). We first tackle the decision problem, i.e. whether there exists a schedule of the activities that, depending on the uncertainty, satisfies all the constraints. We propose a logical approach, based on the reduction to a problem of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), in the theory of Linear Real Arithmetic with Quantifiers. This results in the first implemented solver for weak controllability of DTPUs. Then, we tackle the problem of synthesizing control strategies for scheduling the activities. We focus on strategies that are amenable for efficient execution. We prove that linear strategies are not always sufficient, even in the sub-case of simple TPU (STPU), while piecewise-linear strategies, that are multiple conditionally-applied linear strategies, are always sufficient. We present several algorithms for the synthesis of linear and piecewise-linear strategies, in case of STPU and of DTPU. All the algorithms are implemented on top of SMT solvers. We provide experimental evidence of the scalability of the proposed techniques, with dramatic speed-ups in strategy execution compared to on-line reasoning.},

  abstract = {The extraordinary challenge mission designers, scientists, and engineers, faced in planning the first human expeditions to the surface of another solar system body led to the development of a distinctive and even revolutionary approach to field work. Not only were those involved required to deal effectively with the extreme limitation in resources available for and access to a target as remote as the lunar surface; they were required to developed a rigorous approach to science activities ranging from geological field work to deploying field instruments. Principal aspects and keys to the success of the field work are discussed here, including the highly integrated, intensive, and lengthy science planning, simulation, and astronaut training; the development of a systematic scheme for description and documentation of geological sites and samples; and a flexible yet disciplined methodology for site documentation and sample collection. The capability for constant communication with a `backroom' of geological experts who make requests and weigh in on surface operations was innovative and very useful in encouraging rapid dissemination of information to the greater community in general. An extensive archive of the Apollo era science activity related documents provides evidence of the principal aspects and keys to the success of the field work. The Apollo Surface Journal allows analysis of the astronaut's performance in terms of capability for traveling on foot, documentation and sampling of field stations, and manual operation of tools and instruments, all as a function of time. The application of these analysis as `lessons learned' for planning the next generation of human or robotic field science activities on the Moon and elsewhere are considered here as well.

Architecture is based on conformable tetrahedra, the simplest space-filling form, as building blocks, single or networked, where apices act as nodes from which struts reversibly deploy. The tetrahedral framework acts as a simple skeletal muscular structure. We have already prototyped a simple robotic walker from a single reconfigurable tetrahedron capable of tumbling and a more evolved 12Tetrahedral Walker, the Autonomous Landed Investigator (ALI), which has interior nodes for payload, more continuous motion, and is commandable through a user friendly interface. ALI is an EMS level mission concept which would allow autonomous in situ exploration of the lunar poles within the next decade. ALI would consist of one or more 12tetrahedral walkers capable of rapid locomotion with the many degrees of freedom and equipped for navigation in the unilluminated, inaccessible and thus largely unexplored rugged terrains where lunar resources are likely to be found: the Polar Regions. ALI walkers would act as roving reconnaissance teams for unexplored regions, analyzing samples along the way. \textcopyright{} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) augments an STNU to include observation nodes, the execution of which incrementally and dynamically determines the set of constraints that must be satisfied. Previously, we generalized the notion of dynamic controllability to cover CSTNUs and presented a sound algorithm for determining whether arbitrary CSTNUs are dynamically controllable.

Dynamic plan execution strategies allow an autonomous agent to react quickly to unfolding events, improving the robustness of the agent. Prior work developed methods for dynamically dispatching Simple Temporal Networks, and further research enriched the expressive-ness of the plans executives could handle, including discrete choices, which are the focus of this work. However, in some approaches to date, these additional choices induce significant storage or latency requirements to make flexible execution possible. Drake is designed to leverage the low latency made possible by a preprocessing step called compilation, while avoiding high memory costs through a compact representation. We leverage the concepts of labels and environments, taken from prior work in Assumption-based Truth Maintenance Systems (ATMS), to concisely record the implications of the discrete choices, exploiting the structure of the plan to avoid redundant reasoning or storage. Our labeling and maintenance scheme, called the Labeled Value Set Maintenance System, is distinguished by its focus on properties fundamental to temporal problems, and, more generally, weighted graph algorithms. In particular, the maintenance system focuses on maintaining a minimal representation of non-dominated constraints. We benchmark Drake's performance on random structured problems, and find that Drake reduces the size of the compiled representation by a factor of over 500 for large problems, while incurring only a modest increase in run-time latency, compared to prior work in compiled executives for temporal plans with discrete choices.},

Generated executables are stored as binary files and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. Most of the functionality of the compiler is written in Elisp itself, including several optimization passes, paired with a C back-end to interface with the GNU Emacs core and libgccjit. Though still a work in progress, our implementation is able to bootstrap a functional Emacs and compile all lexically scoped Elisp files, including the whole GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA) [6].

We extend this concept to the Controllable Conditional Temporal Problem with Uncertainty (CCTPU), which extends the STPU by conditioning temporal constraints on the assignment of controllable discrete variables. We define dynamic controllability of a CCTPU as the existence of a strategy that decides on both the values of discrete choice variables and the scheduling of controllable time points dynamically. This contrasts with previous work, which made a static assignment of choice variables and dynamic decisions over time points only. We propose an algorithm to find such a fully dynamic strategy. The algorithm computes the ``envelope'' of outcomes of temporal uncertainty in which a particular assignment of discrete variables is feasible, and aggregates these over all choices. When an aggregated envelope covers all uncertain situations of the CCTPU, the problem is dynamically controllable. However, the algorithm is complete only under certain assumptions. Experiments on an existing set of CCTPU benchmarks show that there are cases in which making both discrete and temporal decisions dynamically it is feasible to satisfy the problem constraints while assigning the discrete variables statically it is not.},

  abstract = {The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this 舠decision舡 problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available舒that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking 舠forever舡 in the case of a formula which is not valid舒and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery. Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples.In the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. 6, below.It should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to 舠genuine舡 mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are 舠short,舡 must be obtained for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this problem is given for ele]]. \textcopyright{} 1960, ACM. All rights reserved.},

In this framework, called temporal constraint satisfaction problem (TCSP), variables represent time points and temporal information is represented by a set of unary and binary constraints, each specifying a set of permitted intervals. The unique feature of this framework lies in permitting the processing of metric information, namely, assessments of time differences between events. We present algorithms for performing the following reasoning tasks: finding all feasible times that a given event can occur, finding all possible relationships between two given events, and generating one or more scenarios consistent with the information provided. We distinguish between simple temporal problems (STPs) and general temporal problems, the former admitting at most one interval constraint on any pair of time points. We show that the STP, which subsumes the major part of Vilain and Kautz's point algebra, can be solved in polynomial time. For general TCSPs, we present a decomposition scheme that performs the three reasoning tasks considered, and introduce a variety of techniques for improving its efficiency. We also study the applicability of path consistency algorithms as preprocessing of temporal problems, demonstrate their termination and bound their complexities. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

The differences between the manifested behavior of the artifact and the predicted behavior of the model guide the search for the differences between the artifact and its model. The diagnostic procedure presented in this paper is model-based, inferring the behavior of the composite device from knowledge of the structure and function of the individual components comprising the device. The system (GDE-general diagnostic engine) has been implemented and tested on many examples in the domain of troubleshooting digital circuits. This research makes several novel contributions: First, the system diagnoses failures due to multiple faults. Second, failure candidates are represented and manipulated in terms of minimal sets of violated assumptions, resulting in an efficient diagnostic procedure. Third, the diagnostic procedure is incremental, exploiting the iterative nature of diagnosis. Fourth, a clear separation is drawn between diagnosis and behavior prediction, resulting in a domain (and inference procedure) independent diagnostic procedure. Fifth, GDE combines model-based prediction with sequential diagnosis to propose measurements to localize the faults. The normally required conditional probabilities are computed from the structure of the device and models of its components. This capability results from a novel way of incorporating probabilities and information theory into the context mechanism provided by assumption-based truth maintenance. \textcopyright{} 1987.},

  abstract = {The problem of translating a formula into a ``good'' clause form is known to be a very important one in resolution automated theorem proving. Some theorems have such a huge clause form that it is practically impossible to prove them by resolution. Several methods exist to reduce clause forms, some applied before and some after translation. They are generally based on (local or non-local) simplifications. A method consisting in the creation and use of definitions, which we call renaming, has been developed in [5], [4] and [7]. Applying it in an exhaustive way was shown to yield a translation into clause form polynomial in size (see [7]). In this paper we investigate non exhaustive renamings in the purpose of minimizing the number of clauses. We obtain a translation which is shown to be polynomial in size, and optimal in number of clauses when the theorem contains no equivalence. An example shows that this translation is not necessarily optimal in presence of equivalence. Experiments with ``challenge'' examples show the practical efficiency of this translation.},

Indeed, many efforts are being made to extend the current planning systems and modelling languages to support such kind of domains. However, hybrid systems often present also a nonlinear behaviour and planning with continuous nonlinear change that is still a challenging issue. In this paper we present the UPMurphi tool, a universal planner based on the discretise and validate approach that is capable of reasoning with mixed discrete/continuous domains, fully respecting the semantics of PDDL+. Given an initial discretisation, the hybrid system is discretised and given as input to UPMurphi, which performs universal planning on such an approximated model and checks the correctness of the results. If the validation fails, the approach is repeated by appropriately refining the discretisation. To show the effectiveness of our approach, the paper presents two real hybrid domains where universal planning has been successfully performed using the UPMurphi tool. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of planning paths for multi-agent systems subject to complex constraints. The technique, called the Decentralized Multi-Agent Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (DMA-RRT) algorithm, extends the Closed-loop RRT (CL-RRT) algorithm to handle multiple agents while retaining its ability to plan quickly. A core component of the DMA-RRT algorithm is a merit-based token passing coordination strategy that makes use of the tree of feasible trajectories grown in the CL-RRT algorithm to dynamically update the order in which agents replan. The reordering is based on a measure of each agent's incentive to change the plan and allows agents with a greater potential improvement to replan sooner, which is demonstrated to improve the team's overall performance compared to a traditional, scripted replan order. The main contribution of the work is a version of the algorithm, called Cooperative DMA-RRT, which introduces a cooperation strategy that allows an agent to modify its teammates' plans in order to select paths that reduce their combined cost. This modification further improves team performance and avoids certain common deadlock scenarios. The paths generated by both algorithms are proven to satisfy inter-agent constraints, such as collision avoidance, and numerous simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate their performance. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Driving is often stressful and dangerous due to uncertainty in the actions of nearby vehicles. Having the ability to model driving maneuvers qualitatively and guarantee safety bounds in uncertain traffic scenarios are two steps towards building trust in vehicle autonomy. In this thesis, we present an approach to the problem of Quali- tative Autonomous Driving (QAD) using risk-bounded conditional planning. First, we present Incremental Risk-aware AO* (iRAO*), an online conditional planning al- gorithm that builds off of RAO* for use in larger dynamic systems like driving. An illustrative example is included to better explain the behavior and performance of the algorithm. Second, we present a Chance-Constrained Hybrid Multi-Agent MDP as a framework for modeling our autonomous vehicle in traffic scenarios using qualitative driving maneuvers. Third, we extend our driving model by adding variable duration to maneuvers and develop two approaches to the resulting complexity. We present planning results from various driving scenarios, as well as from scaled instances of the illustrative example, that show the potential for further applications. Finally, we propose a QAD system, using the different tools developed in the context of this thesis, and show how it would fit within an autonomous driving architecture.},

  abstract = {In recent years, an unprecedented level of interest has grown around the prospect of sending humans to Mars for the exploration and eventual settlement of that planet. With the signing of the 2010 NASA Authorization Act, this goal became the official policy of the United States and consequently, has become the long-term objective of NASA's human spaceflight activities. A review of past Mars mission planning efforts, however, reveals that while numerous analyses have studied the challenges of transporting people to the red planet, relatively little analyses have been performed in characterizing the challenges of sustaining humans upon arrival. In light of this observation, this thesis develops HabNet \textendash{} an integrated Habitation, Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS), In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), and Supportability analysis framework \textendash{} and applies it to three different Mars mission scenarios to analyze the impacts of different system architectures on the costs of deploying and sustaining a continuous human presence on the surface of Mars. Through these case studies, a number of new insights on the mass-optimality of Mars surface system architectures are derived. The most significant of these is the finding that ECLS architecture mass-optimality is strongly dependent on the cost of ISRU \textendash{} where open-loop ECLS architectures become mass-optimal when the cost of ISRU is low, and ECLS architectures with higher levels of resource recycling become mass-optimal when the cost of ISRU is high. For the Martian surface, the relative abundance of resources equates to a low cost of ISRU, which results in an open-loop ECLS system supplemented with ISRU becoming an attractive, if not dominant surface system architecture, over a range of mission scenarios and ISRU performance levels. This result, along with the others made in this thesis, demonstrates the large potential of integrated system analyses in uncovering previously unseen trends within the Mars mission architecture tradespace. By integrating multiple traditionally disparate spaceflight disciplines into a unified analysis framework, this thesis attempts to make the first steps towards codifying the human spaceflight mission architecting process, with the ultimate goal of enabling the efficient evaluation of the architectural decisions that will shape humanity's expansion into the cosmos.},

  abstract = {While in classical planning the objective is to achieve one of the equally attractive goal states at as low total action cost as possible, the objective in deterministic oversubscription planning (OSP) is to achieve an as valuable as possible subset of goals within a fixed allowance of the total action cost. Although numerous applications in various fields share the latter objective, no substantial algorithmic advances have been made in deterministic OSP. Tracing the key sources of progress in classical planning, we identify a severe lack of effective domain-independent approximations for OSP. With our focus here on optimal planning, our goal is to bridge this gap. Two classes of approximation techniques have been found especially useful in the context of optimal classical planning: those based on state-space abstractions and those based on logical land- marks for goal reachability. The question we study here is whether some similar-in-spirit, yet possibly mathematically different, approximation techniques can be developed for OSP. In the context of abstractions, we define the notion of additive abstractions for OSP, study the complexity of deriving effective abstractions from a rich space of hypotheses, and reveal some substantial, empirically relevant islands of tractability. In the context of landmarks, we show how standard goal-reachability landmarks of certain classical planning tasks can be compiled into the OSP task of interest, resulting in an equivalent OSP task with a lower cost allowance, and thus with a smaller search space. Our empirical evaluation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and opens a wide gate for further developments in oversubscription planning.},

I put the two frameworks, decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and the interactive partially observable Markov decision process (I-POMDP), in context and review the foundational algorithms for these frameworks, while briefly discussing the advances in their specializations. I conclude by examining the avenues that research pertaining to these frameworks is pursuing. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 IEEE. The application of LTE technology has evolved from infrastructure-based deployments in licensed bands to new use cases covering ad hoc, device-to-device communications and unlicensed band operation. Vehicular communication is an emerging field of particular interest for LTE, covering in our understanding both automotive (cars) as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. Existing commercial equipment is designed for infrastructure making it unsuitable for vehicular applications requiring low weight and unlicensed band support (e.g. 5.9 GHz ITS-band). In this work, we present tinyLTE, a system design which provides fully autonomous, multi-purpose and ultra-compact LTE cells by utilizing existing open source eNB and EPC implementations. Due to its small form factor and low weight, the tinyLTE system enables mobile deployment on board of cars and drones as well as smooth integration with existing roadside infrastructure. Additionally, the standalone design allows for systems to be chained in a multi-hop configuration. The paper describes the lean and low-cost design concept and implementation followed by a performance evaluation for single and two-hop configurations at 5.9 GHz. The results from both lab and field experiments validate the feasibility of the tinyLTE approach and demonstrate its potential to even support real-time vehicular applications (e.g. with a lowest average end-to-end latency of around 7 ms in the lab experiment).},

To draw upon the advanced methods of constraint satisfaction to solve these types of problems, many dynamic and flexible CSP variants have been proposed. One such variant is the Weighted Conditional CSP (WCCSP). So far, however, little work has been done to extend the full suite of CSP search algorithms to solve these CSP variants. In this paper, we extend Dynamic Backtracking and similar backjumping-based CSP search algorithms to solve WCCSPs by utilizing activity constraints and soft constraints in order to quickly prune infeasible and suboptimal regions of the search space.

  abstract = {Autonomous robots are being considered for increasingly capable roles in our society, such as urban search and rescue, automation for assisted living, and lunar habitat construction. To fulfill these roles, teams of autonomous robots will need to cooperate together to accomplish complex mission objectives in uncertain and dynamic environments. In these environments, autonomous robots face a host of new challenges, such as responding robustly to timing uncertainties and perturbations, task and coordination failures, and equipment malfunctions. In order to address these challenges, this thesis advocates a novel planning approach, called temporally-flexible contingent planning. A temporally-flexible contingent plan is a compact encoding of methods for achieving the mission objectives which incorporates robustness through flexible task durations, redundant methods, constraints on when methods are applicable, and preferences between methods. This approach enables robots to adapt to unexpected changes on-the-fly by selecting alternative methods at runtime in order to satisfy as best possible the mission objectives. The drawback to this approach, however, is the computational overhead involved in selecting alternative methods at runtime in response to changes. If a robot takes too long to select a new plan, it could fail to achieve its near-term mission objectives and potentially incur damage. To alleviate this problem, and extend the range of applicability of temporally-flexible contingent planning to more demanding real-time systems, this thesis proposes a temporally-flexible contingent plan executive that selects new methods quickly and optimally in response to changes in a robot's health and environment. We enable fast and optimal method selection through two complimentary approaches. First, we frame optimal method selection as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) variant, called an Optimal Conditional CSP (OCCSP). Second, we extend fast CSP search algorithms, such as Dynamic Backtracking and Branch-and-Bound Search, to solve OCCSPs. Experiments on an autonomous rover test-bed and on randomly generated plans show that these contributions significantly improve the speed at which robots perform optimal method selection in response to changes in their health status and environment.},

  abstract = {Performing real-time reasoning on models of physical systems is essential in many situations, especially when human intervention is impossible. Since many deductive reasoning tasks take memory or time that is exponential in the number of variables that appear in the model, efforts need to be made to reduce the size of the models used online. The model can be reduced without sacrificing reasoning ability by targeting the model for a specific task, such as diagnosis or reconfiguration. A model may be reduced through model compilation, an offline process where relations and variables that have no bearing on the particular task are removed. This thesis introduces a novel approach to model compilation, through the generation of projected prime implicates and projected prime implicants. Prime implicates and prime implicants compactly represent the consequences of a logical theory. Projection eliminates model variables and their associated prime implicates or implicants that do not contribute to the particular task. This elimination process reduces the size and number of variables appearing in the model and therefore the complexity of the real-time reasoning problem. This thesis presents a minimal conflict generator that efficiently generates projected prime implicates and projected prime implicants. The projected minimal conflict generator uses a generate-and-test approach, in which the candidate generator finds potential minimal conflicts that are then accepted or rejected by the candidate tester. The candidate generator uses systematic search in combination with an iterative deepening algorithm, in order to reduce the space required by the algorithm to a space that is linear in the number of variables rather than exponential. In order to make the algorithm more time efficient, the candidate generator prunes the search space using previously found implicants, as well as minimal conflicts, which identify the sub-spaces that contain no new minimal conflicts. The candidate tester identifies implicants of the model by testing for validity. The tester uses a clause-directed approach along with finite-domain variables to efficiently test for validity. Combined, these techniques allow the tester to test for validity without assigning a value to every variable.T The conflict generator was evaluated on randomly generated models; problems in which models with 20 variables, 5 domain elements each, were projected onto 5 variables. All projected prime implicates were generated from models with 20 clauses within 2 seconds, and from models with 80 clauses within 13 seconds.},

These activities are designed to exercise planetary surface hardware and operations in conditions where long-distance, multi-day roving is achievable, and they allow NASA to evaluate different mission concepts and approaches in an environment less costly and more forgiving than space. The results from the RATS tests allow selection of potential operational approaches to planetary surface exploration prior to making commitments to specific flight and mission hardware development. In previous RATS operations, the Science Support Room has operated largely in an advisory role, an approach that was driven by the need to provide a loose science mission framework that would underpin the engineering tests. However, the extensive nature of the traverse operations for 2010 expanded the role of the science operations and tested specific operational approaches. Science mission operations approaches from the Apollo and Mars-Phoenix missions were merged to become the baseline for this test. Six days of traverse operations were conducted during each week of the 2-week test, with three traverse days each week conducted with voice and data communications continuously available, and three traverse days conducted with only two 1-hour communications periods per day. Within this framework, the team evaluated integrated science operations management using real-time, tactical science operations to oversee daily crew activities, and strategic level evaluations of science data and daily traverse results during a post-traverse planning shift. During continuous communications, both tactical and strategic teams were employed. On days when communications were reduced to only two communications periods per day, only a strategic team was employed. The Science Operations Team found that, if communications are good and down-linking of science data is ensured, high quality science returns is possible regardless of communications. What is absent from reduced communications is the scientific interaction between the crew on the planet and the scientists on the ground. These scientific interactions were a critical part of the science process and significantly improved mission science return over reduced communications conditions. The test also showed that the quality of science return is not measurable by simple numerical quantities but is, in fact, based on strongly non-quantifiable factors, such as the interactions between the crew and the Science Operations Teams. Although the metric evaluation data suggested some trends, there was not sufficient granularity in the data or specificity in the metrics to allow those trends to be understood on numerical data alone.},

Comparisons of three high- and three low-performing teams drawn from five major corporations showed that the high performers mobilized relatively quickly, used comprehensive rather than limited mobilization strategies, and conducted participatory rather than programmed launch meetings. This combination of activities produced a constellation of salutary outputs: more time for the teams to do their work, team members with essential task-related competencies and sufficient time to contribute to their projects, and complete rather than partial performance strategies. In turn, the three salutary outputs formed a constellation of key inner resources that propelled the high-performing teams on a virtuous path of reinforcing activities and outputs that, despite difficulties, ultimately led to success, whereas the absence of one or more of these resources led the low-performing teams down a vacuous path of accumulating confusion and inactivity from which they never recovered. \textcopyright{} 2004 by Johnson Graduate School, Cornell University.},

Probabilistic methods for solving temporal problems exist which quantify and attempt to minimize the probability of schedule failure.

Chance constrained formalism address over-conservatism by imposing bounds on risk, while maximizing utility subject to these risk bounds. In this paper we present the probabilistic Simple Temporal Network (pSTN), a probabilistic formalism for representing temporal problems with bounded risk and a utility over event timing. We introduce a constrained optimisation algorithm for pSTNs that achieves compactness and efficiency through a problem encoding in terms of a parameterised STNU and its reformulation as a parameterised STN. We demonstrate through a car sharing application that our chance-constrained approach runs in the same time as the previous probabilistic approach, yields solutions with utility improvements of at least 5\% over previous arts, while guaranteeing operation within the specified risk bound.},

  abstract = {s Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases have been attracting a significant amount of research, industry, and media attention of late. What is all the excitement about? This article provides an overview of this emerging field, clarifying how data mining and knowledge discovery in databases are related both to each other and to related fields, such as machine learning, statistics, and databases. The article mentions particular real-world applications, specific data-mining techniques, challenges involved in real-world applications of knowledge discovery, and current and future research directions in the field. A cross a wide variety of fields, data are being collected and accumulated at a dramatic pace. There is an urgent need for a new generation of computational theories and tools to assist humans in extracting useful information (knowledge) from the rapidly growing volumes of digital data. These theories and tools are the subject of the emerging field of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). At an abstract level, the KDD field is concerned with the development of methods and techniques for making sense of data. The basic problem addressed by the KDD process is one of mapping low-level data (which are typically too voluminous to understand and digest easily) into other forms that might be more compact (for example, a short report), more abstract (for example, a descriptive approximation or model of the process that generated the data), or more useful (for example , a predictive model for estimating the value of future cases). At the core of the process is the application of specific data-mining methods for pattern discovery and extraction. 1 This article begins by discussing the historical context of KDD and data mining and their intersection with other related fields. A brief summary of recent KDD real-world applications is provided. Definitions of KDD and data mining are provided, and the general mul-tistep KDD process is outlined. This multistep process has the application of data-mining algorithms as one particular step in the process. The data-mining step is discussed in more detail in the context of specific data-mining algorithms and their application. Real-world practical application issues are also outlined. Finally, the article enumerates challenges for future research and development and in particular discusses potential opportunities for AI technology in KDD systems. Why Do We Need KDD? The traditional method of turning data into knowledge relies on manual analysis and interpretation. For example, in the health-care industry, it is common for specialists to periodically analyze current trends and changes in health-care data, say, on a quarterly basis. The specialists then provide a report detailing the analysis to the sponsoring health-care organization ; this report becomes the basis for future decision making and planning for health-care management. In a totally different type of application, planetary geologists sift through remotely sensed images of planets and asteroids, carefully locating and cataloging such geologic objects of interest as impact craters. Be it science, marketing, finance, health care, retail, or any other field, the classical approach to data analysis relies fundamentally on one or more analysts becoming Articles},

An extensive and iterative planning process is required to prepare for each highly choreographed EVA operation. The current planning process relies heavily upon time-consuming heuristic approaches by subject matter experts to essentially "hand-build" each EVA plan. This research develops the EVA Planning Model (EPM), a linear, mixed-integer program intended as a proof- of-concept demonstration for employing formal mathematical optimization techniques to EVA planning. The EPM is thoroughly tested to verify that it functions as intended and is evaluated by expert EVA planners using actual task information. We find that the EPM proves the concept that formal mathematical optimization can be used to aid in subject matter experts in EVA development and planning. It is particularly useful in allowing the evaluation of alternative planning inputs and thorough assessment of EVA plan impacts resulting from external changes.},

  abstract = {Ranking is a fundamental and widely studied problem in scenarios such as search, advertising, and recommendation. However, joint optimization for multi-scenario ranking, which aims to improve the overall performance of several ranking strategies in different scenarios, is rather untouched. Separately optimizing each individual strategy has two limitations. The first one is lack of collaboration between scenarios meaning that each strategy maximizes its own objective but ignores the goals of other strategies, leading to a sub-optimal overall performance. The second limitation is the inability of modeling the correlation between scenarios meaning that independent optimization in one scenario only uses its own user data but ignores the context in other scenarios. In this paper, we formulate multi-scenario ranking as a fully cooperative, partially observable, multi-agent sequential decision problem. We propose a novel model named Multi-Agent Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-RDPG) which has a communication component for passing messages, several private actors (agents) for making actions for ranking, and a centralized critic for evaluating the overall performance of the co-working actors. Each scenario is treated as an agent (actor). Agents collaborate with each other by sharing a global action-value function (the critic) and passing messages that encodes historical information across scenarios. The model is evaluated with online settings on a large E-commerce platform. Results show that the proposed model exhibits significant improvements against baselines in terms of the overall performance.},

Existing automated planning approaches are either based on hybrid model predictive control techniques, which do not scale well due to time discretization, or temporal planners, which sacrifice plan expressivity by only supporting discretized fixed rates of change in continuous effects. We introduce Scotty, a mixed discrete-continuous generative planner that finds the middle ground between these two. Scotty can reason with linear time evolving effects whose behaviors can be modified by bounded control variables, with no discretization involved. Our planner exploits the expressivity of flow tubes, which compactly encapsulate continuous effects, and the performance of heuristic forward search. The generated solution plans are better suited for robust execution, as executives can use the flexibility in both time and continuous control variables to react to disturbances.},

  abstract = {The state of the art practice in robotics planning is to script behaviors manually, where each behavior is typically generated using trajectory optimization. However, in order for robots to be able to act robustly and adapt to novel situations, they need to plan these activity sequences autonomously. Since the conditions and effects of these behaviors are tightly coupled through time, state and control variables, many problems require that the tasks of activity planning and trajectory optimization are considered together. There are two key issues underlying effective hybrid activity and trajectory planning: the sufficiently accurate modeling of robot dynamics and the capability of planning over long horizons. Hybrid activity and trajectory planners that employ mixed integer programming within a discrete time formulation are able to accurately model complex dynamics for robot vehicles, but are often restricted to relatively short horizons. On the other hand, current hybrid activity planners that employ continuous time formulations can handle longer horizons but they only allow actions to have continuous effects with constant rate of change, and restrict the allowed state constraints to linear inequalities. This is insufficient for many robotic applications and it greatly limits the expressivity of the problems that these approaches can solve. In this work we present the ScottyActivity planner, that is able to generate practical hybrid activity and motion plans over long horizons by employing recent methods in convex optimization combined with methods for planning with relaxed plan graphs and heuristic forward search. Unlike other continuous time planners, ScottyActivity can solve a broad class of robotic planning problems by supporting convex quadratic constraints on state variables and control variables that are jointly constrained and that affect multiple state variables simultaneously. In order to support planning over long horizons, ScottyActivity does not resort to time, state or control variable discretization. While straightforward formulations of consistency checks are not convex and do not scale, we present an efficient convex formulation, in the form of a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP), that is very fast to solve. We also introduce several new realistic domains that demonstrate the capabilities and scalability of our approach, and their simplified linear versions, that we use to compare with other state of the art planners. This work demonstrates the power of integrating advanced convex optimization techniques with discrete search methods and paves the way for extensions dealing with non-convex disjoint constraints, such as obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract = {The state of the art practice in robotics planning is to script behaviors manually, where each behavior is typically precomputed in advance. However, in order for robots to be able to act robustly and adapt to novel situations, they need to be able to plan sequences of behaviors and activities autonomously. Since the conditions and effects of these behaviors are tightly coupled through time, state and control variables, many problems require that the tasks of activity planning and trajectory optimization are considered together. There are two key issues underlying effective hybrid activity and trajectory planning: the sufficiently accurate modeling of robot dynamics and the capability of planning over long horizons. Hybrid activity and trajectory planners that employ mixed integer programming within a discrete time formulation are able to accurately model complex dynamics for robot vehicles, but are often restricted to relatively short horizons. On the other hand, current hybrid activity planners that employ continuous time formulations can handle longer horizons but they only allow actions to have continuous effects with constant rate of change, and restrict the allowed state constraints to linear inequalities. This greatly limits the expressivity of the problems that these approaches can solve. In this work we present Scotty, a planning system for hybrid activity and trajectory planning problems. Unlike other continuous time planners, Scotty can solve a broad class of expressive robotic planning problems by supporting convex quadratic constraints on state variables and control variables that are jointly constrained and that affect multiple state variables simultaneously. In order to efficiently generate practical plans for coordinated mobile robots over long horizons, our approach employs recent methods in convex optimization combined with methods for planning with relaxed planning graphs and heuristic forward search. The contributions of this thesis are threefold. First, we introduce a convex, goal-directed scheduling and trajectory planning problem. To solve this problem, we present the ScottyConvexPath planner, which reformulates the problem as a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP). Our formulation allows us to efficiently compute robot trajectories with first order dynamics over long horizons. While straightforward formulations are not convex, we present a convex model that does not require state, control or time discretization. Second, we introduce the ScottyActivity planner, a state of the art hybrid activity and trajectory planner that interleaves heuristic forward search with delete relaxations and consistency checks using our convex model. Finally, we present ScottyPath, a qualitative state plan planner that computes control and obstacle-free state trajectories for robots in order to satisfy the temporally extended goals and constraints that ScottyActivity imposes. ScottyPath finds obstacle-free paths in which all robots are guaranteed to always remain within obstacle-free safe regions, which are computed in advance. We introduce several new robotic planning domains, that we use to evaluate the scalability of our planning system and compare the performance of our approach against other prior methods. Our results show that ScottyActivity performs similarly to other state of the art heuristic forward search activity planners, while solving much more expressive robotic planning problems. On the other hand, ScottyPath can generate obstacle-free paths where robots are contained in obstacle-free convex regions more than two orders of magnitude faster than alternative mixed-integer approaches.},

We provide a formal semantics for PDDL+ by mapping planning instances into constructs of hybrid automata. Using the syntax of HAs as our semantic model we construct a semantic mapping to labelled transition systems to complete the formal interpretation of PDDL+ planning instances. An advantage of building a mapping from PDDL+ to HA theory is that it forms a bridge between the Planning and Real Time Systems research communities. One consequence is that we can expect to make use of some of the theoretical properties of HAs. For example, for a restricted class of HAs the Reachability problem (which is equivalent to Plan Existence) is decidable. PDDL+ provides an alternative to the continuous durative action model of PDDL2.1, adding a more flexible and robust model of time-dependent behaviour. \textcopyright{} 2006 AI Access Foundation.

The AEGIS (Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science) autonomous targeting system has been in routine use on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover since May 2016, selecting targets for the ChemCam remote geochemical spectrometer instrument. AEGIS operates in two modes; in autonomous target selection, it identifies geological targets in images from the rover's navigation cameras, choosing for itself targets that match the parameters specified by mission scientists the most, and immediately measures them with ChemCam, without Earth in the loop. In autonomous pointing refinement, the system corrects small pointing errors on the order of a few milliradians in observations targeted by operators on Earth, allowing very small features to be observed reliably on the first attempt. AEGIS consistently recognizes and selects the geological materials requested of it, parsing and interpreting geological scenes in tens to hundreds of seconds with very limited computing resources. Performance in autonomously selecting the most desired target material over the last 2.5 kilometers of driving into previously unexplored terrain exceeds 93\% (where \textasciitilde 24\% is expected without intelligent targeting), and all observations resulted in a successful geochemical observation. The system has substantially reduced lost time on the mission and markedly increased the pace of data collection with ChemCam. AEGIS autonomy has rapidly been adopted as an exploration tool by the mission scientists and has influenced their strategy for exploring the rover's environment.},

However, many interesting real-world problems can be better represented as Probabilistic Simple Temporal Networks (PSTNs) in which the uncertain durations are represented using potentially-unbounded probability density functions. This can make it inherently impossible to control for all eventualities. In this paper, we propose two new dynamic controllability algorithms that attempt to maximize the likelihood of successfully executing a schedule within a PSTN. The first approach, which we call MIN-LOSS DC, finds a dynamic scheduling strategy that minimizes loss of control by using a conflict-directed search to decide where to sacrifice the control in a way that optimizes overall success. The second approach, which we call MAX-GAIN DC, works in the other direction: it finds a dynamically controllable schedule and then attempts to progressively strengthen it by capturing additional uncertainty. Our approaches are the first known that work by finding maximally dynamically controllable schedules. We empirically compare our approaches against two existing PSTN offline dispatch approaches and one online approach and show that our MIN-LOSS DC algorithm outperforms the others in terms of maximizing execution success while maintaining competitive runtimes.},

Robots are likely to fail due to several causes, which may lead to a poorly connected or a fragmented network. Our purpose is to discuss how to design resilient robot networks. For that, we first demonstrate the problem analyzing the results from a protocol to simulate failures of both central and random (w.r.t. topology) robots. Then, we propose mechanisms for detecting the probability of a robot being in a fragile local configuration and for improving its local robustness. The procedures rely solely on local information: each robot estimates its probability of being in a harmful configuration based on the positions of its neighbors. Such probability is estimated as the number of paths connecting a robot to its 2-hop neighbors by the number of paths existing in the subgraph encompassing its 1-hop and 2-hop neighborhoods. For reversing an adverse configuration, robots change their position to an average position towards their 2-hop neighbors with fewer alternative paths.

  abstract = {Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods have proved highly effective for solving constrained optimization problems with smooth nonlinear functions in the objective and constraints. Here we consider problems with general inequality constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that first derivatives are available and that the constraint gradients are sparse. Second derivatives are assumed to be unavailable or too expensive to calculate. We discuss an SQP algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function and makes explicit provision for infeasibility in the original problem and the QP subproblems. The Hessian of the Lagrangian is approximated using a limited-memory quasi-Newton method. SNOPT is a particular implementation that uses a reduced-Hessian semidefinite QP solver (SQOPT) for the QP subproblems. It is designed for problems with many thousands of constraints and variables but is best suited for problems with a moderate number of degrees of freedom (say, up to 2000). Numerical results are given for most of the CUTEr and COPS test collections (about 1020 examples of all sizes up to 40000 constraints and variables, and up to 20000 degrees of freedom). \textcopyright{} 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

However, all the current approaches to autonomous driving require the automotive manufacturers to shoulder the primary responsibility and liability associated with replacing human perception and decision making with automation, potentially slowing the penetration of autonomous vehicles, and consequently slowing the realization of the societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. We propose here a new approach to autonomous driving that will re-balance the responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous driving between traditional automotive manufacturers, private infrastructure players, and third-party players. Our proposed distributed intelligence architecture leverages the significant advancements in connectivity and edge computing in the recent decades to partition the driving functions between the vehicle, edge computers on the road side, and specialized third-party computers that reside in the vehicle. Infrastructure becomes a critical enabler for autonomy. With this Infrastructure Enabled Autonomy (IEA) concept, the traditional automotive manufacturers will only need to shoulder responsibility and liability comparable to what they already do today, and the infrastructure and third-party players will share the added responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous functionalities. We propose a Bayesian Network Model based framework for assessing the risk benefits of such a distributed intelligence architecture. An additional benefit of the proposed architecture is that it enables 'autonomy as a service' while still allowing for private ownership of automobiles.},

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a widely studied combinatorial optimization problem that has many applications. Due to its intrinsic difficulty and the size of problems encountered in practice, most solution methods for the VRP are heuristic in nature and lead to high quality, yet probably not optimal solutions. When one considers the additional constraints that can be encountered in practice, the need for high quality heuristic methods is clear. We present two new variations of the VRP suggested to us by industry contacts, the Consistent VRP and the Balanced Billing Cycle VRP. We develop solution algorithms that incorporate heuristic methods as well as integer programming. Additionally, we develop a highly effective cooperative parallel algorithm for the classical VRP that generates new best solutions to a number of well-studied benchmark instances. We present extensive computational results and describe the C/C++ library that we developed to solve these vehicle routing problems. We describe the features and design philosophy behind this library and discuss how the framework can be used to implement additional heuristic algorithms and incorporate additional constraints.},

  abstract = {In the past few years deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully employed in a large number of computational problems including, e.g., language processing, image recognition, fraud detection, and computa- tional advertisement. Recently, it has been proposed in the literature to employ deep neural networks (DNNs) together with stochastic gradient descent methods to approximate solutions of PDEs. There are also a few results in the literature which prove that DNNs can approximate solutions of certain PDEs without the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of real parameters used to describe the DNN grows at most polynomially both in the PDE dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. One key argument in most of these results is, first, to use a Monte Carlo approximation scheme which can approximate the solution of the PDE under consideration at a fixed space-time point without the curse of dimensionality and, thereafter, to prove that DNNs are flexible enough to mimic the behaviour of the used approximation scheme. Having this in mind, one could aim for a general abstract result which shows under suitable assumptions that if a certain function can be approximated by any kind of (Monte Carlo) approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality, then this function can also be approximated with DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. It is a key contribution of this article to make a first step towards this direction. In particular, the main result of this paper, essentially, shows that if a function can be approximated by means of some suitable discrete approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality and if there exist DNNs which satisfy certain regularity properties and which approximate this discrete approximation scheme without the curse of dimensionality, then the function itself can also be approximated with DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. As an application of this result we establish that solutions of suitable Kolmogorov PDEs can be approximated with DNNs without the curse of dimensionality.},

This report describes the present situation of Open Scholarship and highlights the main motivations, challenges and obstacles of the transition to Open Scholarship. You will also find the idea of a Knowledge Exchange Open Scholarship Framework, which helps to identify the Arenas (political, economic, social, technology) and the phases of the Research Life Cycle where work needs to be done to better navigate towards Open Scholarship. The report also describes two new important areas of work, first, the Economy of Open Science, and second, Output and Evaluation from the Researcher's Perspective. Both new topics are roughly sketched and more important, the report raises a bunch of questions to better understand "the economy" of Open Scholarship as well as questions to become able to make, mark and rank all types of Output in an Open Scholarship Environment. The report proposes strands of possible works to be carried out by Knowledge Exchange over the next years. Therefore the report highlights gaps in work that addresses the high level issues theory, models and deep understanding of the broad research enterprise as a system and gaps in work that looks beyond single case studies and interventions to try and build understanding from the bottom up. Overall the report can be read like a roadmap for the transition towards Open Scholarship and enhances our conference and report on "Pathways to Open Scholarship".},

This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications.

This implies that elliptic curves with complex multiplication can be canonically lifted to the Witt vectors of the base (these are big and global Witt vectors). We also show that elliptic curves with complex multiplication of Shimura type are precisely those admitting Lambda structures and that a large class of these elliptic curves admit global minimal models. Along the way, we present a detailed study of families of elliptic curves with complex multiplication over arbitrary bases, give new derivations of the reciprocity maps associated to local fields and imaginary quadratic fields, construct a new flat, affine and pro-smooth rigidification of the moduli stack of elliptic curves with complex multiplication and exhibit a relationship between perfect Lambda schemes and periods, both \$p\$-adic and analytic.},

Review revealed that these new techniques give insights into the data, and an intuitive grasp of data families, which show the effectiveness of this approach for enhancing system understanding and assisting with root cause analysis for complex aerospace systems.},

  abstract = {The problem of domain-independent automated planning has been a topic of research in Artificial Intelligence since the very beginnings of the field. Due to the desire not to rely on vast quantities of problem specific knowledge, the most widely adopted approach to automated planning is search. The topic of this thesis is the development of methods for achieving effective search control for domain-independent optimal planning through the construction of admissible heuristics. The particular planning problem considered is the so called ``classical'' AI planning problem, which makes several restricting assumptions. Optimality with respect to two measures of plan cost are considered: in planning with additive cost, the cost of a plan is the sum of the costs of the actions that make up the plan, which are assumed independent, while in planning with time, the cost of a plan is the total execution time \textendash{} makespan \textendash{} of the plan. The makespan optimization objective can not, in general, be formulated as a sum of independent action costs and therefore necessitates a problem model slightly different from the classical one. A further small extension to the classical model is made with the introduction of two forms of capacitated resources. Heuristics are developed mainly for regression planning, but based on principles general enough that heuristics for other planning search spaces can be derived on the same basis. The thesis describes a collection of methods, including the hm, additive hm and improved pattern database heuristics, and the relaxed search and boosting techniques for improving heuristics through limited search, and presents two extended experimental analyses of the developed methods, one comparing heuristics for planning with additive cost and the other concerning the relaxed search technique in the context of planning with time, aimed at discovering the characteristics of problem domains that determine the relative effectiveness of the compared methods. Results indicate that some plausible such characteristics have been found, but are not entirely conclusive.},

The plan execution module is one component of NASA's New Millennium Remote Agent, an artificial intelligence-based space-craft control system architecture which launched in October of 1998 as part of the DEEP SPACE 1 mission. The bottom layer of the plan execution module architecture is a domain specific language, named ESL (Executive Support Language), implemented as an extension to multithreaded COMMON LISP. ESL supports the construction of reactive control mechanisms for autonomous robots and space-craft. For this case study, we translated the ESL services for managing interacting parallel goal-and-event driven processes into the PROMELA input language of SPIN. A total of five previously undiscovered concurrency errors were identified within the implementation of ESL. According to the Remote Agent programming team, the effort has had a major impact, locating errors that would not have been located otherwise and, in one case, identifying a major design flaw. In fact, in a different part of the system, a concurrency bug identical to one discovered by this study escaped testing and caused a deadlock during an in-flight experiment 96 million kilometers from earth. The work additionally motivated the introduction of procedural abstraction in terms of inline procedures into SPIN.},

The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically. \textcopyright{} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

NASA's Resource Prospector (RP) mission is a lunar polar rover mission that will operate primarily in sunlit regions near a lunar pole with near-real time operations to characterize the vertical and horizontal distribution of volatiles. The MVP project was conducted as a field campaign relevant to the RP lunar mission to provide science, payload, and operational lessons learned to the development of a real-time, short-duration lunar polar volatiles prospecting mission. To achieve these goals, the MVP project conducted a simulated lunar rover mission to investigate the composition and distribution of surface and subsurface volatiles in a natural environment with an unknown volatile distribution within the Mojave Desert, improving our understanding of how to find, characterize, and access volatiles on the Moon.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to provide a wide range of services, whereby UAV fleets will be managed by several independent service providers in shared low-altitude airspace. One important element, or redundancy, for safe and efficient UAV operation is pre-flight Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR) methods that generate conflict-free paths for UAVs before the actual flight. Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has already been successfully applied to comparable problems with ground robots. However, most MAPF methods were tested with simplifying assumptions which do not reflect important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as delivery by UAVs where heterogeneous agents need to be considered, and new requests for flight operations are received continuously. In this paper, we extend CBS and ECBS to efficiently incorporate heterogeneous agents with computational geometry and we reduce the search space with spatio-temporal pruning. Moreover, our work introduces a ``batching'' method into CBS and ECBS to address increased amounts of requests for delivery operations in an efficient manner. We compare the performance of our ``batching'' approach in terms of runtime and solution cost to a ``first-come first-served'' approach. Our scenarios are based on a study on UAV usage predicted for 2030 in a real area in Japan. Our simulations indicate that our proposed ECBS based ``batching'' approach is more time efficient than incremental planning based on Cooperative A*, and hence can meet the requirements of timely and accurate response on delivery requests to users of such UTM services.},

  abstract = {Field geological research, as traditionally practiced on Earth, is an extremely fl exible science. Although fi eld geologists plan their traverses ahead of time-nowadays with the advantage of remote-sensing data-initial plans are continually modifi ed in response to observations, such that traverses evolve over time. This research modality differs from that utilized in extreme environments on Earth (e.g., on the ocean fl oor), on the Martian surface by the mobile laboratories Spirit and Opportunity, and by the Apollo astronauts during their explorations of the Moon. Harsh and alien conditions, time constraints, and resource limitations have led to the development of operational modes that provide a constrained and usually lower science return than traditional fi eld geology. However, emerging plans for renewed human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and near-Earth asteroids serve as an opportunity to invent a new paradigm for advanced planetary fi eld geology that embraces coordinated human and robotic research activities. This approach will introduce an operational fl exibility that is more like that of traditional fi eld geology on Earth. In addition, human and robotic collaborations, combined with the integration of new "smart" tools, should provide an augmented reality that leads to even greater science return than traditional fi eld geology. In order to take full advantage of these opportunities when planetary fi eld geology again becomes practical, it is imperative for fi eld geologists on Earth to begin right now to learn how best to incorporate advanced technologies into their research. Geologic studies of analog sites on Earth that employ new technologyenabled strategies rather than traditional research methods provide ideal opportunities to test and refi ne emerging designs for advanced planetary fi eld geologic studies, as well as to gain new insights into terrestrial geologic processes. These operational experiments will be most informative if they embrace the entire geologic research process-including problem defi nition, fi eld observation, and laboratory analysis-and not simply fi eld work. The results of such comprehensive research can be used to inform the design of a maximally effective training regimen for future astronaut explorers. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Geological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Robotic devices, such as rovers and autonomous spacecraft, have been successfully controlled by plan execution systems that use plans with temporal flexibility to dynamically adapt to temporal disturbances. To date these execution systems apply to discrete systems that abstract away the detailed dynamic constraints of the controlled device. To control dynamic, under-actuated devices, such as agile bipedal walking machines, we extend this execution paradigm to incorporate detailed dynamic constraints. Building upon prior work on dispatchable plan execution, we introduce a novel approach to flexible plan execution of hybrid under-actuated systems that achieves robustness by exploiting spatial as well as temporal plan flexibility. To accomplish this, we first transform the high-dimensional system into a set of low dimensional, weakly coupled systems. Second, to coordinate these systems such that they achieve the plan in real-time, we compile a plan into a concurrent timed flow tube description. This description represents all feasible control trajectories and their temporal coordination constraints, such that each trajectory satisfies all plan and dynamic constraints. Finally, the problem of runtime plan dispatching is reduced to maintaining state trajectories in their associated flow tubes, while satisfying the coordination constraints. This is accomplished through an efficient local search algorithm that adjusts a small number of control parameters in real-time. The first step has been published previously; this paper focuses on the last two steps. The approach is validated on the execution of a set of bipedal walking plans, using a high fidelity simulation of a biped.

Given a discretized environment and agents with assigned start and goal locations, MAPF solvers from AI find collision-free paths for hundreds of agents with user-provided sub-optimality guarantees. However, they ignore that actual robots are subject to kinematic constraints (such as velocity limits) and suffer from imperfect plan-execution capabilities. We therefore introduce MAPF-POST to postprocess the output of a MAPF solver in polynomial time to create a plan-execution schedule that can be executed on robots. This schedule works on non-holonomic robots, considers kinematic constraints, provides a guaranteed safety distance between robots, and exploits slack to avoid time-intensive replanning in many cases. We evaluate MAPF-POST in simulation and on differential-drive robots, showcasing the practicality of our approach.},

  abstract = {Distributed consensus is a fundamental primitive for constructing fault-tolerant, strongly-consistent distributed systems. Though many distributed consensus algorithms have been proposed, just two dominate production systems: Paxos, the traditional, famously subtle, algorithm; and Raft, a more recent algorithm positioned as a more understandable alternative to Paxos. In this paper, we consider the question of which algorithm, Paxos or Raft, is the better solution to distributed consensus? We analyse both to determine exactly how they differ by describing a simplified Paxos algorithm using Raft's terminology and pragmatic abstractions. We find that both Paxos and Raft take a very similar approach to distributed consensus, differing only in their approach to leader election. Most notably, Raft only allows servers with up-to-date logs to become leaders, whereas Paxos allows any server to be leader provided it then updates its log to ensure it is up-to-date. Raft's approach is surprisingly efficient given its simplicity as, unlike Paxos, it does not require log entries to be exchanged during leader election. We surmise that much of the understandability of Raft comes from the paper's clear presentation rather than being fundamental to the underlying algorithm being presented.},

In this study, we validate that this new method may qualitatively and quantitatively assess the sympathovagal fluctuation in patients during induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane. Methods: Twenty-eight young patients were allocated for the study. The patients received a tilt test and on the next day they sustained anesthesia induced with inhaled anesthetics. Electrocardiography signals from the patients were relayed to an analogue-digital converter. The Poincar\'e plot is quantified by measuring SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2. Power spectral analyses were performed and LF, HF and HF/LF were calculated. Results: The LF power and the SD2 of the Poincar\'e plot increased while subjects were tilt-up from the supine position. Additionally, a significant correlation were found between LF and SD2, HF and SD1 (p {$<$} 0.05), and LF/HF and SD2/SD1 (p {$<$} 0.01). Sevoflurane inhalation for 10 minutes had no effect on heart rate, but diminished LF, total power and SD1, SD2 of the Poincar\'e plot respectively. However, the LF, SD2 and LF/HF increased; the HF, SD1 and SD1/SD2 ratio decreased after intubation stimulation. Conclusion: Poincar\'e plot and power spectral analysis of HRV during tilt test and sevoflurane induction significantly correlate. Poincar\'e plot analysis is easier and more sensitive at evaluating the sympathovagal balance and observing the beat-to-beat HRV. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012, Taiwan Society of Anesthesiologists.

Ignoring the intentions of the other agents in dynamic environments can lead to risky or over-conservative plans. In this work, we model the motion planning problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose an online system that combines an intent recognition algorithm and a POMDP solver to generate risk-bounded plans for the ego vehicle navigating with a number of dynamic agent vehicles. The intent recognition algorithm predicts the probabilistic hybrid motion states of each agent vehicle over a finite horizon using Bayesian filtering and a library of pre-learned maneuver motion models. We update the POMDP model with the intent recognition results in real time and solve it using a heuristic search algorithm which produces policies with upper-bound guarantees on the probability of near colliding with other dynamic agents. We demonstrate that our system is able to generate better motion plans in terms of efficiency and safety in a number of challenging environments including unprotected intersection left turns and lane changes as compared to the baseline methods.},

In this paper, we propose a variational neural network approach that predicts future driver trajectory distributions for the vehicle based on multiple sensors.Our predictor generates both a conditional variational distribution of future trajectories, as well as a confidence estimate for different time horizons. Our approach allows us to handle inherently uncertain situations, and reason about information gain from each input, as well as combine our model with additional predictors, creating a mixture of experts.We show how to augment the variational predictor with a physics-based predictor, and based on their confidence estimations, improve overall system performance. The resulting combined model is aware of the uncertainty associated with its predictions, which can help the vehicle autonomy to make decisions with more confidence. The model is validated on real-world urban driving data collected in multiple locations. This validation demonstrates that our approach improves the prediction error of a physics-based model by 25\% while successfully identifying the uncertain cases with 82\% accuracy.},

This paper: (1) formally defines the TDP, (2) presents theorems that give necessary and sufficient conditions for solutions to the TDP, (3) presents a family of sound and complete algorithms for solving the TDP, and (4) compares the performance of several variations of the basic algorithm. Although this work was motivated by a problem in collaborative multi-agent planning, it represents a contribution to the theory of Simple Temporal Networks that is independent of the motivating application.},

  abstract = {Morris, Muscettola and Vidal (MMV) presented an algorithm for checking the dynamic controllability (DC) of temporal networks in which certain temporal durations are beyond the control of the planning agent. Their DC-checking algorithm is based on rules for inferring new constraints based on the real-time context within which execution decisions must be made. This paper presents a counter-example to demonstrate that some of the inference rules are, in fact, not sound. The paper fixes the problem by strengthening the definition of dynamic execution strategies to correctly capture the central prohibition against advance knowledge of future events. The new definition enables MMV's soundness proof to go through with minimal changes. It then uses the stronger definition to derive an equivalent, alternative characterization of dynamic execution strategies that highlights the real-time execution decisions that a planning agent must make. The procedural strategy used by MMV in their completeness proof is shown to satisfy the stronger definition, thus ensuring that the DC-checking algorithm is also complete with respect to the stronger definition. As a result, the paper puts MMV's DC-checking algorithm on a more solid theoretical foundation, while also providing a more practical characterization of dynamic execution strategies. \textcopyright{} 2009 IEEE.},

A notion of dynamic controllability for a CSTNU is defined that generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CTP and the dynamic controllability of an STNU.

The algorithm employs two novel techniques. First, new constraints generated by propagation are immediately incorporated into the network using a technique called rotating Dijkstra. Second, a heuristic that exploits the nesting structure of certain paths in the STNU graph is used to determine a good order in which to process the contingent links during constraint propagation.},

The paper carefully argues from basic definitions to proofs of the major theorems on which all of the important algorithmic work on STNUs depends. Although many parts of this presentation have appeared in various forms, in various papers, the scattered nature of the STNU literature has allowed too many holes in the theory to persist, and has relied all too often on proof sketches that leave important details unexamined. The presentation combines results from many sources, while also introducing novel approaches and proofs. The paper concludes by presenting a modified version of a recent algorithm for managing the execution of dynamically controllable STNUs, the fastest reported so far in the literature. The modified version organizes its computations more efficiently and corrects an oversight in the original algorithm.},

Sample collection is also an important planetary field activity, and its success is closely tied to the quality of contextual observations. To test protocols for doing effective planetary geologic field- work, the Desert RATS (Research and Technology Studies) project deployed two prototype rovers for two weeks of simulated exploratory traverses in the San Francisco volcanic field of northern Arizona. The authors of this paper represent the geologist crewmembers who participated in the 2010 field test. We document the procedures adopted for Desert RATS 2010 and report on our experiences regarding these protocols. Careful consideration must be made of various issues that impact the interplay between field geologic observations and sample collection, including time management; strategies related to duplication of samples and observations; logistical constraints on the volume and mass of samples and the volume/transfer of data collected; and paradigms for evaluation of mission success. We find that the 2010 field protocols brought to light important aspects of each of these issues, and we recommend best practices and modifications to training and operational protocols to address them. Underlying our recommendations is the recognition that the capacity of the crew to "flexibly execute" their activities is paramount. Careful design of mission parameters, especially field geologic protocols, is critical for enabling the crews to successfully meet their science objectives. \textcopyright{} 2011 IAA.

At the same time, machine learning models are becoming increasingly sophisticated and exhibit many features often seen in scientific computing, stressing the capabilities of machine learning frameworks. Just as the disciplines of scientific computing and machine learning have shared common underlying infrastructure in the form of numerical linear algebra, we now have the opportunity to further share new computational infrastructure, and thus ideas, in the form of Differentiable Programming. We describe a Differentiable Programming ({$\partial$}P) system that is able to take gradients of Julia programs making Automatic Differentiation a first class language feature. Our system supports almost all language constructs (control flow, recursion, mutation, etc.) and compiles high-performance code without requiring any user intervention or refactoring to stage computations. This enables an expressive programming model for deep learning and, more importantly, it enables users to utilize the existing Julia ecosystem of scientific computing packages in deep learning models. We discuss support for advanced techniques such as mixed-mode, complex and checkpointed differentiation, and present how this leads to efficient code generation. We then showcase several examples of differentiating programs and mixing deep learning with existing Julia packages, including differentiable ray tracing, machine learning on simulated quantum hardware, training neural stochastic differential equation representations of financial models and more.},

Design reference missions (DRMs) currently being considered by NASA for human exploration of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) include stays in the proximity of the target NEA of between 14 and 56 days during which time the Earth-NEA transit vehicle, Deep Space Habitat (DSH), and multipurpose crew vehicle (MPCV, used for crew launch and re-entry) would remain between 500 meters and 2 km away from the NEA to minimize the possibility of collision. Exploration and sampling of the NEA surface would be conducted by crewmembers leaving the DSH in extravehicular activity (EVA) suits with appropriately sized EVA jetpacks to enable brief sor-ties to the NEA surface and/or by using a Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV), which is a small pressurized spacecraft with rapid EVA capability enabling multi-day exploration sorties away from the DSH [2,3]. Methods: The RATS 2012 test focused on optimizing utilization of a four-person crew, DSH, MMSEV, EVA jetpacks, and Mission Control Center operating with 50 seconds each-way communication latency, during exploration within an immersive virtual reality physics-based simulation of the NEA Itokawa (Fig. 1). High-resolution imagery from the Japanese Space Agency's (JAXA) Hayabusa mission was integrated into the simulation and models of three-dimensional boulders of representative sizes, shapes, and distributions were added at specific locations based on inputs from a scientist with expert knowledge of Itokawa. Traverse plans were prepared based on the Hayabusa imagery and using assumptions for sampling and instrument deployment methods and durations based on data from complementary testing in reduced gravity environments [4]. Traverses were planned to include variation in terrain, illumination, and centripe-tal acceleration within each traverse while maintaining consistency among test conditions.},

In addition, the workshop website (https://lunar-landing.arc.nasa.gov) includes video recordings of many of the presentations. This workshop defined a set of targets that near-term landed missions could visit for scientific exploration. The scope of such missions was aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at commercial exploration companies with interests in pursuing ventures on the surface of the Moon. Contributed and invited talks were presented that detailed many high priority landing site options across the surface of the Moon that would meet scientific goals in a wide variety of areas, including impact cratering processes and dating, volatiles, volcanism, magnetism, geophysics, and astrophysics. Representatives from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the European Space Agency also presented about international plans for lunar exploration and science. This report summarizes the set of landing sites and/or investigations that were presented at the workshop that would address high priority science and exploration questions. In addition to landing site discussions, technology developments were also specified that were considered as enhancing to the types of investigations presented. It is evident that the Moon is rich in scientific exploration targets that will inform us on the origin and evolution of the Earth-Moon system and the history of the inner Solar System, and also has enormous potential for enabling human exploration and for the development of a vibrant lunar commercial sector.},

  year = {2016},
  number = {May},
  abstract = {This research addresses the modeling of substantially 3D planetary terrain features, such as skylights, canyons, craters, rocks, and mesas, by a surface robot. The sun lights planetary features with transient, directional illumination. For concave features like skylight pits, craters, and canyons, this can lead to dark shadows. For all terrain features, the ability to detect interest points and to match them between images is complicated by changing illumination, so seeing planetary features in the best light requires a coordinated dance with the sun as it arcs across the sky. The research develops a process for planned-view-trajectory model building that converts a coarse model of a terrain feature and knowledge about illumination change and mission parameters into a view trajectory planning problem, plans and executes a view trajectory, and builds a detailed model from the captured images. An understanding of how view and illumination angles affect model quality is reached through controlled lighting laboratory experiments. The planning of view trajectories, (what to image, from where, and at what time), is cast as an OPTWIND, a new vehicle routing problem formulated in the thesis work. Each part of the planned-view-trajectory model building process is examined in detail, with existing tools identified and tested to solve parts of the problem, where appropriate, and new solutions implemented otherwise. The research also demonstrates planned-view-trajectory model building. Contributions of the research include development, implementation, and demonstration of planned-view-trajectory model building, experimental determination of factors affecting model quality and formulation of view trajectory planning as a new vehicle routing problem. Datasets for planetary analog terrain and for imaging under directional lighting were also collected, totaling over 25,000 images.},

  abstract = {Traffic sensing is a key baseline input for sustainable cities to plan and administer demand-supply management through better road networks, public transportation, urban policies etc., Humans sense the environment frugally using a combination of complementary information signals from different sensors. For example, by viewing and/or hearing traffic one could identify the state of traffic on the road. In this paper, we demonstrate a fusion based learning approach to classify the traffic states using low cost audio and image data analysis using real world dataset. Road side collected traffic acoustic signals and traffic image snapshots obtained from fixed camera are used to classify the traffic condition into three broad classes viz., Jam, Medium and Free. The classification is done on \{10sec audio, image snapshot in that 10sec\} data tuple. We extract traffic relevant features from audio and image data to form a composite feature vector. In particular, we extract the audio features comprising MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) classifier based features, honk events and energy peaks. A simple heuristic based image classifier is used, where vehicular density and number of corner points within the road segment are estimated and are used as features for traffic sensing. Finally the composite vector is tested for its ability to discriminate the traffic classes using Decision tree classifier, SVM classifier, Discriminant classifier and Logistic regression based classifier. Information fusion at multiple levels (audio, image, overall) shows consistently better performance than individual level decision making. Low cost sensor fusion based on complementary weak classifiers and noisy features still generates high quality results with an overall accuracy of 93 - 96\%.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

We investigate this assumption, aiming to enhance the knowledge basis for developing algorithmic standards in big data analytics. First, we argue that big data analytics is by design atheoretical and does not provide process-based explanations of human behavior; thus, it is unfit to support deliberation that is transparent and explainable. Second, we review evidence from interdisciplinary decision science, showing that the accuracy of complex algorithms used in big data analytics for predicting human behavior is not consistently higher than that of simple rules of thumb. Rather, it is lower in situations such as predicting election outcomes, criminal profiling, and granting bail. Big data algorithms can be considered as candidate models for explaining, predicting, and supporting human decision making when they match, in transparency and accuracy, simple, process-based, domain-grounded theories of human behavior. Big data analytics can be inspired by behavioral and cognitive theory},

Several technical challenges arise due to the uncertain environment in which AVs operate such as road and weather conditions, errors in perception and sensory data, and also model inaccuracy. In this paper, we propose a system architecture for risk-aware AVs capable of reasoning about uncertainty and deliberately bounding the risk of collision below a given threshold. We discuss key challenges in the area, highlight recent research developments, and propose future research directions in three subsystems. First, a perception subsystem that detects objects within a scene while quantifying the uncertainty that arises from different sensing and communication modalities. Second, an intention recognition subsystem that predicts the driving-style and the intention of agent vehicles (and pedestrians). Third, a planning subsystem that takes into account the uncertainty, from perception and intention recognition subsystems, and propagates all the way to control policies that explicitly bound the risk of collision. We believe that such a white-box approach is crucial for future adoption of AVs on a large scale.},

First, we present a variant of the Reactive Model-based Programming Language (RMPL), that allows for the expression of complex concurrent activites, metric time constraints and multiple contingencies. Second, we introduce the Temporal Planning Network (TPN), a simple, compact encoding of all possible executions of an RMPL program, that supports a model of program interpretation as fast temporal planning.

The KIRK planning system takes as input a problem expressed as a RMPL program, and compiles it into a temporal plan network (TPN), similar to those used by temporal planners, but extended for symbolic constraints and decisions. This intermediate representation clarifies the relation between temporal planning and causal-link planning, and permits a single task model to be used for planning and execution. Such a unified model has been described as a holy grail for autonomous agents by the designers of the Remote Agent[Muscettola et al., 1998b].},

We use this approach to parallelize the A* algorithm in the optimal sequential version of the Fast Downward planner. The scaling behavior of the algorithm is evaluated experimentally on clusters using up to 128 processors, a significant increase compared to previous work in parallelizing planners. We show that this approach scales well, allowing us to effectively utilize the large amount of distributed memory to optimally solve problems which require hundreds of gigabytes of RAM to solve.

The domain of fire- fighting was selected, and the research focused on the decisions made by fire ground commanders (FGCs). Interviews were conducted with 26 experienced FGCs (mean experience of 23 years). Each interview covered a critical incident that was nonroutine and that demanded expertise. A total of 156 decision points were probed in this way. In less than 12\% of them was there any evidence of simultaneous comparisons and relative evaluation of two or more options. In over 80\% of the decision points, the strat- egy was for the FGCs to use their experience to directly identify the situation as typical of a standard prototype and to identify a course of action as typical for that prototype. In this way, the FGCs handled decision points without any need to consider more than one option. A recognition-primed decision (RPD) model was synthesized from these data, which emphasized the use of recognition rather than calculation or analysis for rapid decision making},

  abstract = {This paper uses the isoefficiency metric to analyze the scalability of several parallel algorithms for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a densely connected graph. Parallel algorithms analyzed in this paper either have been previously presented elsewhere or are small variations of them. Scalability is analyzed with respect to mesh, hypercube, and shared-memory architectures. We demonstrate that isoefficiency functions are a compact and useful predictor of performance. In fact, previous comparative predictions of some of the algorithms based on experimental results are shown to be incorrect whereas isoefficiency functions predict correctly. We find the classic trade-offs of hardware cost vs time and memory vs time to be represented here as trade-offs of hardware cost vs scalability and memory vs scalability. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the motion planning and control subsystems of Team MIT's entry in the 2007 DARPA Grand Challenge. The novelty is in the use of closed-loop prediction in the framework of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). Unlike the standard RRT, an input to the controller is sampled, followed by the forward simulation using the vehicle model and the controller to compute the predicted trajectory. This enables the planner to generate smooth trajectories much more efficiently, while the randomization allows the planner to explore cluttered environment. The controller consists of a Proportional-Integral speed controller and a nonlinear pure-pursuit steering controller, which are used both in execution and in the simulation-based prediction. The main advantages of the forward simulation are that it can easily incorporate any nonlinear control law and nonlinear vehicle dynamics, and the resulting trajectory is dynamically feasible. By using a stabilizing controller, it can handle vehicles with unstable dynamics. Several results obtained using MIT's race vehicle demonstrate these features of the approach. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

  abstract = {We are interested in two-layer ReLU neural networks from an optimization per- spective. We prove that the path-connected sublevel set, i.e., valleys, of a neural network which is Clarke stationary with respect to the training loss with weight de- cay regularization contains a specific, simpler and more structured neural network, which we call its minimal representation. We provide an explicit construction of a continuous path between the neural network and its minimal counterpart. Impor- tantly, we show that characterizing the optimality properties of a neural network can be reduced to characterizing those of its minimal representation. Thanks to the specific structure of minimal neural networks, we show that we can embed them into a convex optimization landscape. Leveraging convexity, we are able to (i) characterize the minimal size of the hidden layer so that the neural network optimization landscape has no spurious valleys and (ii) provide a polynomial-time algorithm for checking if a neural network is a global minimum of the training loss. Overall, we provide a rich framework for studying the landscape of the neural network training loss through our embedding to a convex optimization landscape.},

In the space domain, execution of temporally flexible plans has provided an enabler for achieving the desired coordination and robustness. We address the challenge of extending plan execution to under-actuated systems that are controlled indirectly through the setting of continuous state variables. Our solution is a novel model-based executive that takes as input a temporally flexible state plan, specifying intended state evolutions, and dynamically generates a near-optimal control sequence. To achieve optimality and safety, the executive plans into the future, framing planning as a disjunctive programming problem. To achieve robustness to disturbances and tractability, planning is folded within a receding horizon, continuous planning framework. Key to performance is a problem reduction method based on constraint pruning. We benchmark performance through a suite of UAV scenarios using a hardware-in-the-loop testbed.

  author = {Levine, Steven James},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {There is an ever-growing demand for humans and robots to work fluidly together in a number of important domains, such as home care, manufacturing, and medical robotics. In order to achieve this fluidity, robots must be able to (1) recognize their human teammate's intentions, and (2) automatically adapt to those intentions in an intelligent manner. This thesis makes progress in these areas by proposing a framework that solves these two problems (task-level intent recognition and robotic adaptation) concurrently and holistically, using a single model and set of algorithms for both. The result is a mixed-initiative human-robot interaction that achieves the team's goals. The robot is able to reason about the action requirements, timing constraints, and unexpected disturbances in order to adapt intelligently to the human. We extend this framework by additionally maintaining a probabilistic belief over the human's intentions. We develop a risk-aware executive that performs concurrent intent recognition and adaptation. Our executive continuously assesses the risk asso- ciated with plan execution, selects adaptations that are safe enough, asks uncertainty- reducing questions when appropriate, and provides a proactive early warning of likely failure. Finally, we present an extension to this work which enables the robot to save time by ignoring potentially many, vanishingly-unlikely scenarios. To achieve this behavior, we frame concurrent intent recognition and adaptation as a constraint satisfaction problem, and compactly represent their associated solutions and policies using compiled structures that are updated online as new observations arise. Through the use of these compiled structures, the robot efficiently reasons about which actions to perform, as well as when to perform them \textendash{} thereby ensuring decision making consistent with the team's goals.},

  abstract = {When controlling an autonomous system, it is inefficient or sometimes impossible for the human operator to specify detailed commands. Instead, the field of AI autonomy has developed goal-directed systems, in which human operators specify a series of goals to be accomplished. Increasingly, the control of autonomous systems involves performing a mix of discrete and continuous actions. For example, a typical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mission involves discrete actions, like get GPS and set sonar, and continuous actions, like descend and ascend, which involve continuous dynamics of the vehicle. Accordingly, we develop a hybrid planner that determines a series of discrete and continuous actions that achieve the mission goals. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to solving the generative planning problem for hybrid systems, involving both continuous and discrete actions. The planner, Kongming 1, incorporates two innovations. First, it employs a compact representation of all hybrid plans, called a Hybrid Flow Graph, which combines the strengths of a Planning Graph for discrete actions and Flow Tubes for continuous actions. Second, it encodes the Hybrid Flow Graph as a mixed logic linear/nonlinear program, which it solves using an off-theshelf solver. We empirically demonstrate that Kongming can efficiently plan for real-world scenarios that are based on science missions performed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).

  abstract = {Coverage of interest points and network connectivity are two main challenging and practically important issues of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Although many studies have exploited the mobility of sensors to improve the quality of coverage andconnectivity, little attention has been paid to the minimization of sensors' movement, which often consumes the majority of the limited energy of sensors and thus shortens the network lifetime significantly. To fill in this gap, this paper addresses the challenges of the Mobile Sensor Deployment (MSD) problem and investigates how to deploy mobile sensors with minimum movement to form a WSN that provides both target coverage and network connectivity. To this end, the MSD problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: the Target COVerage (TCOV) problem and the Network CONnectivity (NCON) problem. We then solve TCOV and NCON one by one and combine their solutions to address the MSD problem. The NP-hardness of TCOV is proved. For a special case of TCOV where targets disperse from each other farther than double of the coverage radius, an exact algorithm based on the Hungarian method is proposed to find the optimal solution. For general cases of TCOV, two heuristic algorithms, i.e., the Basic algorithm based on clique partition and the TV-Greedy algorithm based on Voronoi partition of the deployment region, are proposed to reduce the total movement distance ofsensors. For NCON, an efficient solution based on the Steiner minimum tree with constrained edge length is proposed. Thecombination of the solutions to TCOV and NCON, as demonstrated by extensive simulation experiments, offers a promising solutionto the original MSD problem that balances the load of different sensors and prolongs the network lifetime consequently.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of effort and major investment dedicated to reducing bias in organizational settings, it persists. The central challenge in removing bias from decisions is that most biases operate unconsciously. While raising awareness can help people to realize that they might be biased, it does not enable them to recognize bias in their own thinking\textemdash we simply do not have conscious access to the operations of bias in the brain.In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to mitigating bias, derived from a brain-based perspective. We identify processes that can interrupt and redirect unconsciously biased thinking. We provide The SEEDS ModelTM for designing and guiding the use of such processes. The SEEDSModelTM simplifies the roughly 150 identified cognitive biases and recognizes five categories of bias, each category responsive to a different set of actions that will help mitigate them. To use The SEEDS ModelTM, we propose three steps: 1. Accept that we are biased by virtue of our biology; 2. Label the type of bias that might influence a particular decision, using The SEEDSModelTM;3. Mitigate using the right process.},

As the asynchronous observations from different cameras will great reduce the accuracy of the trajectory estimation, the proposed approach will main focus on increasing the estimation accuracy under those asynchronous observations via concerning the flying ball's motion consistency. The approximate polynomial trajectory model for the flying ball is built to optimize the best parameters from the asynchronous observations in each discrete temporal interval. The experiments show the proposed approach can performance much better than the method that ignores the asynchrony and can achieve the similar performance as the hardware-triggered synchronizing based method, which cannot be deployed in the real onboard vision system due to the limited bandwidth and real-time output requirement.},

  abstract = {The deployment ofrobot swarms is influenced by real-world factors, such as motor issues, sensor failure, and wind disturbances. These factors cause the appearance of faulty robots. In a decentralized swarm, sharing incorrect information from faulty robots will lead to undesired swarm behaviors, such as swarm disconnection and incorrect heading directions. We envision a system where a human operator is exerting supervisory control over a remote swarm by indicating changes in trust to the swarm via a "trust-signal". By cor- recting faulty behaviors, trust between the human and the swarm is maintained to facilitate human-swarm cooperation. In this research, a trust-aware behavior reflection method \textendash{} Trust-R \textendash{} is designed based on a weighted mean subsequence reduced algorithm (WMSR). By using Trust-R, detected faulty behaviors are automatically cor- rected by the swarm in a decentralized fashion by referring to the motion status of their trusted neighbors and isolating failed robots from the others. Based on real-world scenarios, three types of robot faults \textendash{} degraded performance caused by motor wear, abnormal motion caused by system uncertainty and motion deviation caused by an external disturbance such as wind \textendash{} were simulated to test the effectiveness of Trust-R. Results show that Trust-R is effective in correcting swarm behaviors for swarm self-healing.},

MicroGrid can be defined as low voltage distributed power networks comprising various distributed generators (DG), storage and controllable loads, which can be operated as interconnected or as islands from the main power grid. By representing each element in MicroGrid as an autonomous intelligent agent, multi agent modeling of a MicroGrid is designed and implemented. JADE framework is proposed for the modeling and reliability of the MicroGrid is confirmed with PowerWorld Simulator. Further, the FIPA contract net coordination between the agents is demonstrated through software simulation. As a result, this paper provides a MicroGrid modeling which has the necessary communication and coordination structure to create a scalable system.

One common feature of robot architectures is the modular decomposition of systems into simpler and largely independent components. These components implement primitive actions and report events about their state. The robot programming framework proposed here includes a tool (RoboGraph) to program and coordinate the activity (tasks) of these middleware modules. Project developers use the same task programming IDE (RoboGraph) on two different levels. The first is to program tasks that must be executed autonomously by one robot and the second is to program tasks that can include several robots and building elements. Tasks are described using a Signal Interpreted Petri Net (SIPN) editor and stored in an xml file. A dispatcher loads these files and executes the different Petri nets as needed. A monitor that shows the state of all the running nets is very useful for debugging and tracing purposes. The whole system has been used in several applications: A tour-guide robot (GuideBot), a multi-robot surveillance project (WatchBot) and a hospital food and laundry transportation system based on mobile robots. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A challenging and critical task is to explore the movement patterns of different traffic-agents and predict their future trajectories accurately to help the autonomous vehicle make reasonable navigation decision. To solve this problem, we propose a long short-term memory-based (LSTM-based) realtime traffic prediction algorithm, TrafficPredict. Our approach uses an instance layer to learn instances' movements and interactions and has a category layer to learn the similarities of instances belonging to the same type to refine the prediction. In order to evaluate its performance, we collected trajectory datasets in a large city consisting of varying conditions and traffic densities. The dataset includes many challenging scenarios where vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians move among one another. We evaluate the performance of TrafficPredict on our new dataset and highlight its higher accuracy for trajectory prediction by comparing with prior prediction methods.},

  abstract = {One of the most important paradigm shifts in the use of SAT solvers for solving industrial problems has been the introduction of clause learning. Clause learning entails adding a new clause for each conflict during backtrack search. This new clause prevents the same conflict from occurring again during the search process. Moreover, sophisticated techniques such as the identification of unique implication points in a graph of implications, allow creating clauses that more precisely identify the assignments responsible for conflicts. Learned clauses often have a large number of literals. As a result, another paradigm shift has been the development of new data structures, namely lazy data structures, which are particularly effective at handling large clauses. These data structures are called lazy due to being in general unable to provide the actual status of a clause. Efficiency concerns and the use of lazy data structures motivated the introduction of dynamic heuristics that do not require knowing the precise status of clauses. This chapter describes the ingredients of conflict-driven clause learning SAT solvers, namely conflict analysis, lazy data structures, search restarts, conflict-driven heuristics and clause deletion strategies.},

GRASP is premised on the inevitability of conflicts during search and its most distinguishing feature is the augmentation of basic backtracking search with a powerful conflict analysis procedure. Analyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack non-chronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially pruning large portions of the search space. In addition, by ``recording'' the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and preempt the occurrence of similar con- flicts later on in the search. Finally, straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up to conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for a solution to be found. Experimental results obtained from a large number of benchmarks, including many from the field of test pattern generation, indicate that application of the proposed conflict analy- sis techniques to SAT algorithms can be extremely effective for a large number of representative classes of SAT instances.},

Some of these techniques are specific to SAT, whereas others are similar in spirit to approaches in other fields of Artificial Intelligence. GRASP is premised on the inevitability of conflicts during the search and its most distinguishing feature is the augmentation of basic backtracking search with a powerful conflict analysis procedure. Analyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack nonchronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially pruning large portions of the search space. In addition, by \textordfeminine recording\textordmasculine{} the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and preempt the occurrence of similar conflicts later on in the search. Finally, straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up to conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for a solution to be found. Experimental results obtained from a large number of benchmarks indicate that application of the proposed conflict analysis techniques to SAT algorithms can be extremely effective for a large number of representative classes of SAT instances.},

Through Playbook, a planning and scheduling software tool, we have incrementally increased the ability for Earth analog mission crews to modify their schedules. Playbook allows the crew to add new activities from scratch, add new activities or groups of activities through a Task List, and reschedule or reassign flexible activities. The crew is also able to identify if plan modifications create violations, i.e., plan constraints not being met. This paper summarizes our observations with qualitative evidence from four NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) analog missions that supported self-scheduling as a feasible operational concept.},

We address this need by presenting an algorithm for converting a set of qualitative ceteris paribus preferences into a quantitative utility function. Our algorithm is complete for a finite universe of binary features. Constructing the utility function can, in the worst case, take time exponential in the number of features. Common forms of independence conditions reduce the computational burden. We present heuristics using utility independence and constraint based search to achieve efficient utility functions.},

The goal of the project is to define a resilient, risk-aware software architecture for onboard, real-time autonomous operations that can robustly handle uncertainty in spacecraft behavior within hazardous and unconstrained environments, without unnecessarily increasing complexity. The architecture, called the Resilient Spacecraft Executive (RSE), has been designed to support three functions: (1) adapting to component failures to allow graceful degradation, (2) accommodating environments, science observations, and spacecraft capabilities that are not fully known in advance, and (3) making risk-aware decisions without waiting for slow ground-based reactions. In implementation, the bulk of the RSE effort has focused on the parts of the architecture used for goal-directed execution and control, including the deliberative, habitual, and reexive modules. We specify the capabilities and constraints needed for each module, and discuss how we have extended the current state-of-the-art algorithms so that they can supply the required functionality, such as risk-aware planning in the deliberative module that conforms to mission operator-supplied priorities and constraints. Furthermore, the RSE architecture is modular to enable extension and reconfiguration, as long as the embedded algorithmic components exhibit the required risk-aware behavior in the deliberative module and risk-bounded behavior in the habitual module. To that end, we discuss some feasible, useful RSE configurations and deployments for a Mars rover case and an autonomous underwater vehicle case. We also discuss additional capabilities that the architecture requires to support needed resiliency, such as onboard analysis and learning.},

Load balancing is achieved via agent migration from heavily loaded nodes to lightly loaded ones. The credit based concept is used for the dual objective of: (1) the selection of candidate agents for migration, and (2) the selection of destination nodes. This represents an elaboration of previous research work aimed at the selection of agents only. Multiple linear regression is used to achieve our dual objective. A complexity analysis for the proposed system operation is performed, the complete operation is O(n 2) where n is the number of agents on the local host. The proposed system is implemented using JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework), the multiple linear regression operation is performed using R Tool. The experimental results show a modified system operation in terms of reduced user's query response time, by implementing agent load balancing. \textcopyright{} 2012 Ain Shams University.

  abstract = {The design and development processes for decision support systems (DSS) can have important implications for yielding desirable and effective design solutions. This disserta- tion seeks to understand, and ultimately provide a meaningful pathway to generating useful decision support system designs for use in environments that do not yet exist (e.g. envi- sioned worlds). The contributions of this thesis are two fold. The first is domain specific and addresses the known deficiencies that will impact future human extravehicular opera- tions. The second is methodological and generalizable across many domains. Central to this effort is realizing that design requirements are the medium through which hypothe- sized system designs are built. This dissertation first demonstrates that cognitive systems engineering (CSE) methods can be applied to yield design insight in the form of high level design requirements amenable to traditional systems engineering processes (Chapter 3). Second, this dissertation demonstrates how a subset of those requirements, along side en- visioning and testing within a future work context, can yield prototype designs suitable for supporting future extravehicular activity (EVA) operations (Chapter 4 and 5). Finally, this dissertation evaluated the resultant prototypes against the requirements to demonstrate both validity of the requirements and the verification of the design (Chapter 6). The intent here is to first define what is required by the domain and hypothesis how new design solutions might be capable to promote desired capabilities specified by the requirements derived from the work in Chapter 3. As a result, this thesis contributes the underlying science needed to design a DSS within the EVA work domain for future mission operations.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 by the International Astronautical Federation. All rights reserved. This paper presents the research, design, and development efforts aimed at constructing next generation software that supports human extravehicular activity (EVA), commonly known as a spacewalk. EVA operations today rely on an extensive team of Earth-based flight controllers who actively monitor and direct EVA progress while maintaining crew and vehicle safety. However, future deep-space mission destinations will impose round-trip communication delays. In the case of Mars, round-trip delays range from 8 to 40 minutes. As a result, astronauts will need to rely on local decision support systems (DSS) to make tactical decisions during execution without Earth-based support personnel. This paper first presents the content, structure and form of existing EVA support systems that were leveraged as source material for prototype development. Then detailed descriptions of the engineering specifications and design features are provided of the two prototypes, (Baseline and Advanced), that were built. Finally, the phases software development and corresponding architectures are discussed. As a result of this effort, this study was able to harness the rapid prototyping capabilities and broad platform support of modern web technologies to iterate on designs and successfully deploy a high fidelity system to controlled laboratory simulations and NASA analog research sites. The results of this work provide an empirically derived set of design solutions to guide the future of EVA operational support systems for future human spaceflight missions.},

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Future human planetary spaceflight missions to destinations such as the Moon or Mars aim to pro- mote human scientific exploration, yet outside of the Apollo program, the spaceflight community at large has limited experience performing scientific exploration. An open area of research is designing future human missions to enable exploration in support of scientific goals. One approach to overcome this lim- ited spaceflight experience is to learn from present-day expert scientists performing terrestrial scientific fieldwork. By studying and understanding the intrinsic work demands, constraints, and behaviors that field scientists must overcome and perform to achieve their scientific fieldwork objectives in present-day terrestrial settings, their scientific needs can be better understood within the context of proposed future missions and technologies. This paper presents the research formulation, prototype data capture sys- tems, and preliminary testing results of the Scientific Physical and Operation Characterization (SPOC) project, which aims to better understand the constraints that shape the process of scientific exploration in present-day terrestrial fieldwork as a means to inform future spaceflight planetary exploration concepts of operations. This research employs two complementary methodologies, cognitive work analysis and wearable sensor measurement, to unpack the cognitive and biomechanical constraints that shape scien- tists' actions in field settings. This paper first describes the methodology associated with simultaneously assessing the cognitive and physical dimensions of field work to illustrate the utility and application of this combined approach. A detailed description is then provided of the data capture system and data processing pipeline used to study science field teams and streamline post hoc analysis. Three field-ready 1 data collection configurations were designed with combinations of commercial off the shelf audio, video, remote sensing equipment, and wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), depending on the role of the personnel in the field team (i.e. the scientist, the cognitive researcher, the physical sensors researcher). Finally, this paper presents the cognitive and physical task characterizations of scientists' activities that resulted from incremental proof-of-concept data capture sessions with scientists performing field activities in both laboratory-based and natural environmental settings. By modeling a more complete representa- tion of scientific fieldwork, these testing efforts will contribute to the formulation of necessary scientific capabilities and needs that promote scientific exploration, including informing future mission hardware and software development and mission concept of operations.},

  abstract = {Certain planning systems that deal with quantitative time constraints have used an underlying Simple Temporal Problem solver to ensure temporal consistency of plans. However, many applications involve processes of uncertain duration whose timing cannot be controlled by the execution agent. These cases require more complex notions of temporal feasibility. In previous work, various ``controllability'' properties such as Weak, Strong, and Dynamic Controllability have been defined. The most interesting and useful Controllability property, the Dynamic one, has ironically proved to be the most difficult to analyze. In this paper, we resolve the complexity issue for Dynamic Controllability. Unexpectedly, the problem turns out to be tractable. We also show how to efficiently execute networks whose status has been verified.},

  abstract = {We explore a means to both model and reason about partial observability within the scope of constraint-based temporal reasoning. Prior studies of uncertainty in Temporal CSPs have required the realization of all exogenous processes to be made entirely visible to the agent. We relax this assumption and propose an extension to the Simple Temporal Problem with Uncertainty (STPU), one in which the executing agent is made aware of the occurrence of only a subset of uncontrollable events. We argue that such a formalism is needed to encode those complex environments whose external phenomena share a common, hidden source of temporal causality. After characterizing the levels of controllability in the resulting Partially Observable STPU and various special cases, we generalize a known family of reduction rules to account for this relaxation, introducing the properties of extended contingency and sufficient observability. We demonstrate that these modifications enable a polynomial filtering algorithm capable of determining a local form of dynamic controllability; however, we also show that there do remain some instances whose global controllability cannot yet be correctly identified by existing inference rules, leaving the true computational complexity of dynamic controllability an open problem for future research.

  abstract = {Dispatchability is an important property for the efficient execution of temporal plans where the temporal constraints are represented as a Simple Temporal Network (STN). It has been shown that every STN may be reformulated as a dispatchable STN, and dispatchability ensures that the temporal constraints need only be satisfied locally during execution. Recently it has also been shown that Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty, augmented with wait edges, are Dynamically Controllable provided every projection is dispatchable. Thus, the dispatchability property has both theoretical and practical interest. One thing that hampers further work in this area is the underdeveloped theory. The existing definitions are expressed in terms of algorithms, and are less suitable for mathematical proofs. In this paper, we develop a new formal theory of dispatchability in terms of execution sequences. We exploit this to prove a characterization of dispatchability involving the structural properties of the STN graph. This facilitates the potential application of the theory to uncertainty reasoning.},

Durative actions are represented by using a pair of events, and a number of temporal formalisms can be expressed by a combination of temporal constraints in an STN (e.g., many of the rules of Allen's Interval Algebra [Allen, 1984]). Executing the events in an STN is referred to as dispatching the network, and a network that can be dispatched properly is called consistent. The problem of checking the consistency of a STN is referred to as a the Simple Temporal Problem, and remains as an integral part of planning systems today (e.g., checking the continued consistency of a network in temporal planners).},

Most previous work on oversubscription planning was restricted to only non-negative utility functions and 0-binary utility functions. While this restriction allows using techniques similar to partial satisfaction planning, it limits the expressivity of the formalism. In this paper, we address oversubscription planning with general additive utility functions over a finite-domain representation. We introduce the notions of net utility of an action, and of a gross positive action. Using these notions, we prove several properties about the structure of an optimal plan, which are then compiled into a classical planning problem. The landmarks of this classical planning problem are value driven landmarks of the original oversubscription problem, that is, they must occur in any action sequence which improves utility. An empirical evaluation demonstrates that these landmarks are more informative than previous state-of-the-art methods for landmark discovery for oversubscription planning, and lead to better planning performance.},

  abstract = {This paper is an attempt to present the development and application of a practical teaching module introducing Python programming techniques to electronics, computer, and bioengineering students at an undergraduate level before they encounter digital signal processing and its applications in junior or senior level courses. The Fourier transform takes a signal in time domain, switches it into the frequency domain, and vice versa. Fourier Transforms are extensively used in engineering and science in a vast and wide variety of fields including concentrations in acoustics, digital signal processing, image processing, geophysical processing, wavelet theory, and optics and astronomy. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is an essential digital signal processing tool that is highly desirable if the integral form of the Fourier Transform cannot be expressed as a mathematical equation. The key to spectral analysis is to choose a window length that suits the signal to be analyzed, since the length of the window used for DFT calculations has a substantial impact on the information the DFT can provide. The operation count of the DFT algorithm is time-intensive, and as such a number of Fast Fourier Transform methods have been developed to adequately perform DFT efficiently. This paper will explain how this learning and teaching module was instrumental in progressive learning for students by presenting Python programming and the general theory of the Fourier Transform in order to demonstrate how the DFT and FFT algorithms are derived and computed through leverage of the Python data structures. This paper thereby serves as an innovative way to expose technology students to this difficult topic and gives them a fresh taste of Python programming while having fun learning the Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms. \&copy; American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.},

Information technology, and Artificial Intelligence in particular, will play a central role in this endeavor by endowing these explorers with a form of computational intelligence that we call remote agents. In this paper we describe the Remote Agent, a specific autonomous agent architecture based on the principles of model-based programming, on-board deduction and search, and goal-directed closed-loop commanding, that takes a significant step toward enabling this future. This architecture addresses the unique characteristics of the spacecraft domain that require highly reliable autonomous operations over long periods of time with tight deadlines, resource constraints, and concurrent activity among tightly coupled subsystems. The Remote Agent integrates constraint-based temporal planning and scheduling, robust multi-threaded execution, and model-based mode identification and reconfiguration. The demonstration of the integrated system as an on-board controller for Deep Space One, NASA's first New Millennium mission, is scheduled for a period of a week in mid 1999. The development of the Remote Agent also provided the opportunity to reassess some of AI's conventional wisdom about the challenges of implementing embedded systems, tractable reasoning, and knowledge representation. We discuss these issues, and our often contrary experiences, throughout the paper. \textcopyright{} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. \textcopyright{} 2010 IEEE.},

The BASALT research program simulated a series of extravehicular activities (EVAs) in Mars analog terrains under various Mars-relevant bandwidth and latency conditions to investigate how best to approach this problem. Here we discuss tactical decision-making under these conditions, that is, how the crew on Mars interacts with a team of scientists and support personnel on Earth to collect samples of maximum scientific interest. We describe the strategies, protocols, and tools tested in BASALT EVAs and give recommendations on how best to conduct human exploration of Mars with support from Earth-based scientists. We find that even with scientists supporting them, the crew performing the exploration must be trained in the appropriate scientific disciplines in order to provide the terrestrial scientists with enough information to make decisions, but that with appropriate planning and structure, and tools such as a "dynamic leaderboard," terrestrial scientists can add scientific value to an EVA, even under Mars communication latency.},

As such networks are generated it is essential to verify that they are dynamically controllable - executable regardless of the outcomes of uncontrollable durations - and to convert them to a dispatchable form. The previously published FastIDC algorithm achieves this incrementally and can therefore be used efficiently during plan construction. In this paper we show that FastIDC is not sound when new constraints are added, sometimes labeling networks as dynamically controllable when they are not. We analyze the algorithm, pinpoint the cause, and show how the algorithm can be modified to correctly detect uncontrollable networks.

  abstract = {It is generally hard to predict the exact duration of an action. Uncertainty in durations is often modeled in temporal planning by the use of upper bounds on durations, with the assumption that if an action happens to be executed more quickly, the plan will still succeed. However, this assumption is often false: If we finish cooking too early, the dinner will be cold before everyone is ready to eat. Simple Temporal Problems with Uncertainty (STPUs) allow us to model such situations. An STPU-based planner must verify that the plans it generates are executable, captured by the property of dynamic controllability. The Efficient IDC (EIDC) algorithm can do this incrementally during planning, with an amortized complexity per step of O(n3) but a worst-case complexity per step of O(n4). In this paper we show that the worst-case run-time of EIDC does occur, leading to repeated reprocessing of nodes in the STPU while verifying the dynamic controllability property. We present a new version of the algorithm, EIDC2, which through optimal ordering of nodes avoids the need for reprocessing. This gives EIDC2 a strictly lower worst-case run-time, making it the fastest known algorithm for incrementally verifying dynamic controllability of STPUs.},

  abstract = {Temporal formalisms are essential for reasoning about actions that are carried out over time. The exact durations of such actions are generally hard to predict. In temporal planning, the resulting uncertainty is often worked around by only considering upper bounds on durations, with the assumption that when an action happens to be executed more quickly, the plan will still succeed. However, this assumption is often false: if we finish cooking too early, the dinner will be cold before everyone is ready to eat. Using simple temporal networks with uncertainty (STNU), a planner can correctly take both lower and upper duration bounds into account. It must then verify that the plans it generates are executable regardless of the actual outcomes of the uncertain durations. This is captured by the property of dynamic controllability (DC), which should be verified incrementally during plan generation. Recently a new incremental algorithm for verifying dynamic controllability was proposed: EfficientIDC, which can verify if an STNU that is DC remains DC after the addition or tightening of a constraint (corresponding to a new action being added to a plan). The algorithm was shown to have a worst case complexity of O(n4) for each addition or tightening. This can be amortized over the construction of a whole STNU for an amortized complexity in O(n3). In this paper we improve the EfficientIDC algorithm in a way that prevents it from having to reprocess nodes. This improvement leads to a lower worst case complexity in O(n3).}

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of classical planning for multiple cooperative agents who have private information about their local state and capabilities they do not want to reveal. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to solve this type of problem -- one is based on reduction to distributed constraint satisfaction, and the other on partial-order planning techniques. In classical single-agent planning, constraint-based and partial-order planning techniques are currently dominated by heuristic forward search. The question arises whether it is possible to formulate a distributed heuristic forward search algorithm for privacy-preserving classical multi-agent planning. Our work provides a positive answer to this question in the form of a general approach to distributed state-space search in which each agent performs only the part of the state expansion relevant to it. The resulting algorithms are simple and efficient -- outperforming previous algorithms by orders of magnitude -- while offering similar flexibility to that of forward-search algorithms for single-agent planning. Furthermore, one particular variant of our general approach yields a distributed version of the A* algorithm that is the first cost-optimal distributed algorithm for privacy-preserving planning.},

The first algorithm is a modification of a previous DKF algorithm presented by the author in CDC-ECC '05. The previous algorithm was only applicable to sensors with identical observation matrices which meant the process had to be observable by every sensor. The modified DKF algorithm uses two identical consensus filters for fusion of the sensor data and covariance information and is applicable to sensor networks with different observation matrices. This enables the sensor network to act as a collective observer for the processes occurring in an environment. Then, we introduce a continuous-time distributed Kalman filter that uses local aggregation of the sensor data but attempts to reach a consensus on estimates with other nodes in the network. This peer-to-peer distributed estimation method gives rise to two iterative distributed Kalman filtering algorithms with different consensus strategies on estimates. Communication complexity and packet-loss issues are discussed. The performance and effectiveness of these distributed Kalman filtering algorithms are compared and demonstrated on a target tracking task. \textcopyright{} 2007 IEEE.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos.

Since the disturbance is unbounded, it is impossible to achieve zero probability of violating constraints. Our goal is to optimize the expected value of an objective function while limiting the probability of violating any constraints over the planning horizon (joint chance constraint). Prior arts include ellipsoidal relaxation approach[1] and Particle Control[2], but the former yields very conservative result and the latter is computationally intensive. Our approach divide the optimization problem into two stages; the upper-stage that optimizes risk allocation, and the lower-stage that optimizes control sequence with tightened constraints. The lower-stage is a regular convex optimization, such as Linear Programming or Quadratic Programming. The upper-stage is also convex, but the objective function is not always differentiable. We developed a fast descent algorithm for the upper-stage called Iterative Risk Allocation (IRA), which yield much smaller suboptimality than ellipsoidal relaxation method while achieving a substantial speedup compared to and Particle Control. \textcopyright{} 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a model-based planner called the Probabilistic Sulu Planner or the p-Sulu Planner, which controls stochastic systems in a goal directed manner within user-specified risk bounds. The objective of the p-Sulu Planner is to allow users to command continuous, stochastic systems, such as unmanned aerial and space vehicles, in a manner that is both intuitive and safe. To this end, we first develop a new plan representation called a chance-constrained qualitative state plan (CCQSP), through which users can specify the desired evolution of the plant state as well as the acceptable level of risk. An example of a CCQSP statement is "go to A through B within 30 minutes, with less than 0.001\% probability of failure." We then develop the p-Sulu Planner, which can tractably solve a CCQSP planning problem. In order to enable CCQSP planning, we develop the following two capabilities in this paper: 1) risk-sensitive planning with risk bounds, and 2) goal-directed planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints. The first capability is to ensures that the probability of failure is bounded. The second capability is essential for the planner to solve problems with a continuous state space such as vehicle path planning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the p-Sulu Planner by simulations on two real-world scenarios: the path planning and scheduling of a personal aerial vehicle as well as the space rendezvous of an autonomous cargo spacecraft. \textcopyright{} 2013 AI Access Foundation.

All the algorithms are clearly presented as instantiation of Online Mirror Descent or Follow-The-Regularized-Leader and their variants. Particular attention is given to the issue of tuning the parameters of the algorithms and learning in unbounded domains, through adaptive and parameter-free online learning algorithms. Non-convex losses are dealt through convex surrogate losses and through randomization. The bandit setting is also briefly discussed, touching on the problem of adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits. These notes do not require prior knowledge of convex analysis and all the required mathematical tools are rigorously explained.

  abstract = {The trend to increasingly capable and affordable control processors has generated an explosion of embedded real-time gadgets that serve almost every function imaginable. The daunting task of programming these gadgets is greatly alleviated with real-time deductive engines that perform all execution and monitoring functions from a single core model. Fast response times are achieved using an incremental propositional deductive database (an LTMS). Ideally the cost of an LTMS's incremental update should be linear in the number of labels that change between successive contexts. Unfortunately an LTMS can expend a significant percentage of its time working on labels that remain constant between contexts. This is caused by the LTMS's conservative approach: a context switch first removes all consequences of deleted clauses, whether or not those consequences hold in the new context. This paper presents a more aggressive incremental TMS, called the ITMS, that avoids processing a significant number of these consequences that are unchanged. Our empirical evaluation for spacecraft control shows that the overhead of processing unchanged consequences can be reduced by a factor of seven.},

The SST was composed of scientists from a variety of disciplines and operations researchers who provided scientific and technical expertise to the crew while each EVA was being conducted (intra-EVA). SST management and organization developed under operational conditions that included Mars-like communication latencies, bandwidth constraints, and EVA plans that were infused with Mars analog field science objectives.

Over the course of BASALT field deployments to Idaho and Hawai'i, the SST team made several changes of note to increase both productivity and efficiency. For example, new roles were added for more effective management of technical discussions, and the layout of the SST workspace evolved multiple times during the deployments. SST members' reflexive adjustments resulted in a layout that prioritized face-To-face discussions over face-To-data displays, highlighting the importance of interpersonal communication during SST decision-making. In tandem with these workspace adjustments, a range of operational techniques were developed to help the SST manage discussions and information flow under time pressure.},

Once a decision that science activities, particularly geoscience, should be pursued, considerable debate ensued over how to accomplish this. Questions arose over instruments and tools required, samples and photos to be returned, landing site selection, and crew composition. Answers to these questions required major efforts for planning traverses on the Moon and training the astronauts in the extensive procedures necessary in low gravity to use tools, set up instruments, take adequate photos, collect and document samples, and provide proper descriptions. In addition to astronauts on the surface, an astronaut in lunar orbit managed additional instruments, photography and verbal descriptions. Training for these activities averaged nearly one hundred hours per month for over a year for each crew. There were many problems as the training progressed: adjusting groups and backgrounds of the training personnel for the best combination of personalities and skills, overcoming logistical troubles, revising awkward procedures, determining optimum means of communications between all involved groups, and devising contingency procedures for real-time problems. By the last mission these problems were overcome.},

Hybrid domain models capture a more accurate representation of real world problems that involve continuous processes than is possible using discrete systems. However, solving problems represented as PDDL+ domains is very challenging due to the construction of complex system dynamics, including non-linear processes and events. In this paper we introduce DiNo, a new planner capable of tackling complex problems with non-linear system dynamics governing the continuous evolution of states. DiNo is based on the discretise-and-validate approach and uses the novel Staged Relaxed Planning Graph+ (SRPG+) heuristic, which is introduced in this paper.

However, re-targeting existing scientific computing workloads to machine learning frameworks is both costly and limiting, as scientific simulations tend to use the full feature set of a general purpose programming language. In this manuscript we develop an infrastructure for incorporating deep learning into existing scientific computing code through Differentiable Programming ({$\partial$}P). We describe a {$\partial$}P system that is able to take gradients of full Julia programs, making Automatic Differentiation a first class language feature and compatibility with deep learning pervasive. Our system utilizes the one-language nature of Julia package development to augment the existing package ecosystem with deep learning, supporting almost all language constructs (control flow, recursion, mutation, etc.) while generating high-performance code without requiring any user intervention or refactoring to stage computations. We showcase several examples of physics-informed learning which directly utilizes this extension to existing simulation code: neural surrogate models, machine learning on simulated quantum hardware, and data-driven stochastic dynamical model discovery with neural stochastic differential equations.},

  abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage ``a picture is worth a thousand words'' might well be ``a model is worth a thousand datasets.'' Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring ``big data''. In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating climate simulations by 15,000x, can be handled by training UDEs.},

This initial meeting's participants included personnel from multiple NASA centers (HQ, JSC, KSC, ARC, and JPL), academia, and ESA. It included all of the known studies, analog missions, and tests of time delayed communications dating back to the Apollo missions including NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO), Desert Research and Technology Studies (DRATS/RATS), International Space Station Test-bed for Analog Research (ISTAR), Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP), Mars 520, JPL Mars Orbiters/Rovers, Advanced Mission Operations (AMO), Devon Island analog missions, and Apollo experiences. Additionally, the meeting attempted to capture all of the various functional perspectives via presentations by disciplines including mission operations (flight director and mission planning), communications, crew, Capcom, Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP), Medical/Surgeon, Science, Education and Public Outreach (EPO), and data management. The paper summarizes the descriptions and results from each of the activities discussed at the TIM and includes several recommendations captured in the meeting for dealing with time delay in human exploration along with recommendations for future development and studies to address this issue.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

In this work we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we highlight a learning bias of deep networks towards low frequency functions - i.e. functions that vary globally without local fluctuations - which manifests itself as a frequency-dependent learning speed. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks prioritize learning simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate the role of the shape of the data manifold by presenting empirical and theoretical evidence that, somewhat counter-intuitively, learning higher frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity.},

Moreover, these approaches either do not pro-vide an ability to incorporate feedback, or only incorporate feedback as hard constraints without any inference. Our approach uses online feedback from users and greatly automates the modeling process by incorporating web data in categorical and textual form into the model. This al-gorithm makes decision aids more robust in large domains by discovering a hierarchy over the variables, and increases flexibility by learning simultaneously from textual and cat-egorical data. Furthermore, semantics provide an efficient way of searching through assignments. In addition, we in-tegrate our semantic relaxation algorithm with a temporal relaxation algorithm to obtain feedback on preferences over both semantic and temporal relations, making the decision aid applicable to more real world scenarios. Empirical re-sults demonstrate that our method aligns well with human judgment when making recommendations.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information.

One tool we in the Analog Missions Project at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) utilize to validate exploration system architecture concepts and conduct technology demonstrations, while gaining a deeper understanding of system-wide technical and operational challenges, is our analog missions. Analog missions are multi-disciplinary activities that test multiple features of future spaceflight missions in an integrated fashion to gain a deeper understanding of system-level interactions and integrated operations. These missions frequently occur in remote and extreme environments that are representative in one or more ways to that of future spaceflight destinations. They allow us to test robotics, vehicle prototypes, habitats, communications systems, in-situ resource utilization, and human performance as it relates to these technologies. And they allow us to validate architectural concepts, conduct technology demonstrations, and gain a deeper understanding of system-wide technical and operational challenges needed to support crewed missions beyond LEO. As NASA develops a capability driven architecture for transporting crew to a variety of space environments, including the moon, near-Earth asteroids (NEA), Mars, and other destinations, it will use its analog missions to gather requirements and develop the technologies that are necessary to ensure successful human exploration beyond LEO. Currently, there are four analog mission platforms: Research and Technology Studies (RATS), NASA's Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO), In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), and International Space Station (ISS) Test bed for Analog Research (ISTAR).},

Common approaches to online motion planning and execution execute sequential goals independently, and do not consider the full plan when planning for the next goal. This often results in suboptimal or infeasible plans. Some hybrid and temporal planners are capable of generating motion plans for multiple vehicles with multiple goals over long horizons. However, the dynamics considered are often too simple to be executed by real systems. We present an executive planner that plans local trajectories using sufficiently accurate dynamics while considering the rest of the global plan constraints in the far future. We achieve this by repeatedly solving a single, multi-fidelity optimization problem, where we combine higher fidelity discrete-time dynamics to generate the local trajectory and lower fidelity continuous-time dynamics to capture the full remaining plan, guiding the local trajectory. We evaluate our multi-goal executive planner against a naive, myopic executive and demonstrate the scala-bility on a set of expressive real-world scenarios.},

These improvements lift the efficiency of SAT based planning to the same level as best planners that use other search methods. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Logic, and declarative representation of knowledge in general, have long been a preferred framework for problem solving in AI. However, specific subareas of AI have been eager to abandon general-purpose knowledge representation in favor of methods that seem to address their computational core problems better. In planning, for example, state-space search has in the last several years been preferred to logic-based methods such as SAT. In our recent work, we have demonstrated that the observed performance differences between SAT and specialized state-space search methods largely go back to the difference between a blind (or at least planning-agnostic) and a planning-specific search method. If SAT search methods are given even simple heuristics which make the search goal-directed, the efficiency differences disappear.},

Interventions to reduce alarms without jeopardizing patient safety target either inaccurate or clinically irrelevant alarms, so assessment of alarm accuracy and clinical relevance may enhance the rigor of alarm intervention studies done in clinical units. Objectives To (1) examine approaches used to measure accuracy and/or clinical relevance of physiological monitor alarms in intensive care units and (2) compare the proportions of inaccurate and clinically irrelevant alarms. Methods An integrative review was used to systematically search the literature and synthesize resulting articles. Results Twelve studies explicitly measuring alarm accuracy and/or clinical relevance on a clinical unit were identified. In the most rigorous studies, alarms were annotated retrospectively by obtaining alarm data and parameter waveforms rather than being annotated in real time. More than half of arrhythmia alarms in recent studies were inaccurate. However, contextual data were needed to determine alarms' clinical relevance. Proportions of clinically irrelevant alarms were high, but definitions of clinically irrelevant alarms often included inaccurate alarms. Conclusions Future studies testing interventions on clinical units should include alarm accuracy and/or clinical relevance as outcome measures. Arrhythmia alarm accuracy should improve with advances in technology. Clinical interventions should focus on reducing clinically irrelevant alarms, with careful consideration of how clinical relevance is defined and measured.},

  abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable for modeling many physical phenomena and also commonly used for solving image processing tasks. In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite-dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. For the last few decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing problems through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction. In this paper, we establish a new PDE interpretation of a class of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used to learn from speech, image, and video data. Our interpretation includes convolution residual neural networks (ResNet), which are among the most promising approaches for tasks such as image classification having improved the state-of-the-art performance in prestigious benchmark challenges. Despite their recent successes, deep ResNets still face some critical challenges associated with their design, immense computational costs and memory requirements, and lack of understanding of their reasoning. Guided by well-established PDE theory, we derive three new ResNet architectures that fall into two new classes: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs. We demonstrate how PDE theory can provide new insights and algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate the competitiveness of three new CNN architectures using numerical experiments.},

Known as In Situ Resource Utilization or ISRU, the ability to convert space resources into useful and mission critical products has been shown in numerous studies to be mission and architecture enhancing or enabling. However at the time of the release of the US Vision for Space Exploration in 2004, only concept feasibility hardware for ISRU technologies and capabilities had been built and tested in the laboratory; no ISRU hardware had ever flown in a mission to the Moon or Mars. As a result, an ISRU development project was established with phased development of multiple generations of hardware and systems. To bridge the gap between past ISRU feasibility hardware and future hardware needed for space missions, and to increase confidence in mission and architecture planners that ISRU capabilities would meet exploration needs, the ISRU development project incorporated extensive ground and analog site testing to mature hardware, operations, and interconnectivity with other exploration systems linked to ISRU products. This report documents the series of analog test activities performed from 2008 to 2012, the stepwise progress achieved, and the end-to-end system and mission demonstrations accomplished in this test program.},

  author = {Santanta, Pedro},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {A special report on the cover of the June 2016 issue of the IEEE Spectrum maga- zine reads: "can we trust robots?" In a world that has been experiencing a seem- ingly irreversible process by which autonomous systems have been given increasingly more space in strategic areas such as transportation, manufacturing, energy supply, planetary exploration, and even medical surgeries, it is natural that we start asking ourselves if these systems could be held at the same or even higher levels of safety than we expect from humans. In an effort to make a contribution towards a world of autonomy that we can trust, this thesis argues that one necessary step in this direc- tion is the endowment of autonomous agents with the ability to dynamically adapt to their environment while meeting strict safety guarantees. From a technical standpoint, we propose that autonomous agents in safety-critical applications be able to execute conditional plans (or policies) within risk bounds (also referred to as chance constraints). By being conditional, the plan allows the autonomous agent to adapt to its environment in real-time by conditioning the choice of activity to be executed on the agent's current level of knowledge, or belief, about the true state of world. This belief state is, in turn, a function of the history of potentially noisy sensor observations gathered by the agent from the environment. With respect to bounded risk, it refers to the fact that executing such conditional plans should guarantee to keep the agent "safe" - as defined by sets of state constraints - with high probability, while moving away from the conservatism of minimum risk approaches. In this thesis, we propose Chance-Constrained Partially Observable Markov De- cision Processes (CC-POMDP's) as a formalism for conditional risk-bounded plan- ning under uncertainty. Moreover, we present Risk-bounded AO* (RAO*), a heuris- tic forward search-based algorithm that searches for solutions to a CC-POMDP by leveraging admissible utility and risk heuristics to simultaneously guide the search and perform early pruning of overly-risky policy branches. In an effort to facilitate the specification of risk-bounded behavior by human modelers, we also present the Chance-constrained Reactive Model-based Programming Language (cRMPL), a novel variant of RMPL that incorporates chance constraints as part of its syntax. Finally, in support of the temporal planning applications with duration uncertainty that this thesis is concerned about, we present the Polynomial-time Algorithm for Risk-aware Scheduling (PARIS) and its extension to conditional scheduling of Probabilistic Tem- poral Plan Networks (PTPN's). The different tools and algorithms developed in the context of this thesis are com- bined to form the Conditional Planning for Autonomy with Risk (CLARK) system, a risk-aware conditional planning system that can generate chance-constrained, dy- namic temporal plans for autonomous agents that must operate under uncertainty. With respect to our empirical validation, each component of CLARK is benchmarked against the relevant state of the art throughout the chapters, followed by several demonstrations of the whole CLARK system working in tandem with other building blocks of an architecture for autonomy.},

Second, we present RAO, a heuristic forward search algorithm producing optimal, deterministic, finite-horizon policies for CCPOMDP's. In addition to the utility heuristic, RAO leverages an admissible execution risk heuristic to quickly detect and prune overly-risky policy branches. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of RAO in two challenging domains of practical interest: power supply restoration and autonomous science agents.},

The basic problem formulation is to have the vehicles move from an initial dynamic state to a final state without colliding with each other, while at the same time avoiding other stationary and moving obstacles. It is shown that this problem can be rewritten as a linear program with mixed integer/linear constraints that account for the collision avoidance. A key benefit of this approach is that the path optimization can be readily solved using the CPLEX optimization software with an AMPL/Matlab interface. An example is worked out to show that the framework of mixed integer/linear programming is well suited for path planning and collision avoidance problems. Implementation issues are also considered. In particular, we compare receding horizon strategies with fixed arrival time approaches.},

Our experiments show that this procedure can be used to solve hard, randomly generated problems that are an order of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by more traditional approaches such as the Davis-Putnam procedure or resolution. We also show that GSAT can solve structured satisfiability problems quickly. In particular, we solve encodings of graph coloring problems, N-queens, and Boolean induction. General application strategies and limitations of the ap- proach are also discussed. GSAT is best viewed as a model-finding procedure. Its good performance suggests that it may be advan- tageous to reformulate reasoning tasks that have tra- ditionally been viewed as theorem-proving problems as model-finding tasks.},

  abstract = {Autonomous systems operating in real-world environments must be able to plan, schedule, and execute missions while robustly adapting to uncertainty and disturbances. Previous work on dispatchable execution increases the efficiency of plan execution under uncertainty by introducing a temporal plan dispatcher that schedules events dynamically in response to disturbances, and a compiler that reduces a plan to a dispatchable form that enables real-time scheduling. However, this work does not address the situation where response requires modifying the plan in real-time. In these situations, after the autonomous system replans, compilation to dispatchable form must occur in near real-time. The key contribution of this paper is a fast Incremental Dynamic Control algorithm (IDC) for maintaining the dispatchability of a partially controllable plan, in response to incremental plan modifications by an online planner. IDC is developed as a set of incremental update rules that exploit the structure of the plan in order to efficiently propagate the effects of constraint loosening and tightening throughout the plan. IDC exhibits an order of magnitude improvement in compile time over the state of the art nonincremental algorithm applied to randomly generated problems. Its practicality is demonstrated on plans for coordinating rovers within the authors' hardware test-bed.},

Prior research into learning from demonstrations (LfD) has failed to capture this notion of the acceptability of an execution; meanwhile, temporal logics provide a flexible language for expressing task specifications. Inspired by this, we present Bayesian specification inference, a probabilistic model for inferring task specification as a temporal logic formula. We incorporate methods from probabilistic programming to define our priors, along with a domain-independent likelihood function to enable sampling-based inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model for inferring specifications with over 90\% similarity between the inferred specification and the ground truth, both within a synthetic domain and a real-world table setting task.},

  abstract = {In order for an autonomous agent to successfully complete its mission, the agent must be able to quickly re- plan on the fly, as unforeseen events arise in the environment. This is enabled through the use of temporally flexible plans, which allow the agent to adapt to execution uncertainties, by not over committing to timing constraints, and through continuous planners, which are able to replan at any point when the current plan fails. To achieve both of these requirements, planners must have the ability to reason quickly about timing constraints. We enable continuous, temporally flexible planning through a temporal consistency algorithm (ITC), which supports incremental consistency testing on a new type of disjunctive temporal constraint network, the Temporal Plan Network (TPN), and supports focused search through incremental conflict extraction. The ITC algorithm combines the speed of shortest-path algorithms known to network optimization with the spirit of incremental algorithms such as Incremental A* and those used within truth maintenance systems (TMS). Empirical studies of ITC applied to the Kirk temporal planner demonstrate an order of magnitude speed increase on cooperative air vehicle scenarios and on randomly generated plans.

The state space for the problem is the space of state oc- cupancy probability distributions (the unit simplex). The development of the algorithm introduces several new ideas, including the class of finitely transient policies, which are shown to possess piecewise linear cost functions. The paper develops easily implemented ap- proximations to stationary policies based on these finitely transient policies and shows that the concave hull of an approximation can be included in the well-known Howard policy improvement algo- rithm with subsequent convergence. The paper closes with a detailed example illustrating the application of the algorithm to the two-state partially observable Markov process.},

  year = {2004},
  abstract = {In the future, groups of autonomous robots will cooperate in large networks in order to achieve a common goal. These multi-agent systems will need to be able to execute cooperative temporal plans in the presence of temporal uncertainty and communication limitations. The duration of many planned activities will not be under direct control of the robots. In addition, robots will often not be able to communicate during plan execution. In order for the robots to robustly execute a cooperative plan, they will need to guarantee that a successful execution strategy exists, and provide a means to reactively compensate for the uncertainty in real-time. This thesis presents a multi-agent executive that enables groups of distributed autonomous robots to dynamically schedule temporally flexible plans that contain both temporal uncertainty under communication limitations. Previous work has presented controllability algorithms that compile the simple temporal networks with uncertainty, STNUs, into a form suitable for execution. This thesis extends the previous controllability algorithms to operate on two-layer plans that specify group level coordination at the highest level and agent level coordination at a lower level. We introduce a Hierarchical Reformulation (HR) algorithm that reformulates the two-layer plan in order to enable agents to dynamically adapt to uncertainty within each group plan and use a static execution strategy between groups in order to compensate for communication limitations. Formally, the HR algorithm ensures that the two-layer plan is strongly controllable at the highest level and dynamically controllable at the lower level. Furthermore, we introduce a new fast dynamic controllability algorithm that has been empirically shown to run in O(N 3) time.},

  abstract = {When performing a task it is important for teams to optimize their strategies and actions to maximize value and avoid the cost of surprise. The decisions teams make sometimes have unintended consequences and they must then reorganize their thinking, roles and/or configuration into corrective structures more appropriate for the situation. In this study we ask: What are the neurodynamic properties of these reorganizations and how do they relate to the moment-by-moment, and longer, performance-outcomes of teams?. We describe an information-organization approach for detecting and quantitating the fluctuating neurodynamic organizations in teams. Neurodynamic organization is the propensity of team members to enter into prolonged (minutes) metastable neurodynamic relationships as they encounter and resolve disturbances to their normal rhythms. Team neurodynamic organizations were detected and modeled by transforming the physical units of each team member's EEG power levels into Shannon entropy-derived information units about the team's organization and synchronization. Entropy is a measure of the variability or uncertainty of information in a data stream. This physical unit to information unit transformation bridges micro level social coordination events with macro level expert observations of team behavior allowing multimodal comparisons across the neural, cognitive and behavioral time scales of teamwork. The measures included the entropy of each team member's data stream, the overall team entropy and the mutual information between dyad pairs of the team. Mutual information can be thought of as periods related to team member synchrony. Comparisons between individual entropy and mutual information levels for the dyad combinations of three-person teams provided quantitative estimates of the proportion of a person's neurodynamic organizations that represented periods of synchrony with other team members, which in aggregate provided measures of the overall degree of neurodynamic interactions of the team. We propose that increased neurodynamic organization occurs when a team's operating rhythm can no longer support the complexity of the task and the team needs to expend energy to re-organize into structures that better minimize the "surprise" in the environment. Consistent with this hypothesis, the frequency and magnitude of neurodynamic organizations were less in experienced military and healthcare teams than they were in more junior teams. Similar dynamical properties of neurodynamic organization were observed in models of the EEG data streams of military, healthcare and high school science teams suggesting that neurodynamic organization may be a common property of teamwork. The innovation of this study is the potential it raises for developing globally applicable quantitative models of team dynamics that will allow comparisons to be made across teams, tasks and training protocols.},

This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text.There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published.A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.},

Students' top coping strategies included: seeking social support, working, exercising, watching television, and creating a comfortable routine. The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted female students' research progress more than males', and female doctoral students reported feeling anxious, upset, and irritable when engaging in academic work, while males felt enthusiastic. Finally, general anxiety and stress was higher in females than males during the COVID-19 outbreak. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Plenty of such methods have been designed to accomplish this task: most of them deal with undirected and unweighted networks only, but a few are capable of handling directed and/or weighted networks too, thus properly exploiting richer information. In this work, we contribute to the effort of comparing the different methods for comparing networks and providing a guide for the selection of an appropriate one. First, we review and classify a collection of network comparison methods, highlighting the criteria they are based on and their advantages and drawbacks. The set includes methods requiring known node-correspondence, such as DeltaCon and Cut Distance, as well as methods not requiring a priori known node-correspondence, such as alignment-based, graphlet-based, and spectral methods, and the recently proposed Portrait Divergence and NetLSD. We test the above methods on synthetic networks and we assess their usability and the meaningfulness of the results they provide. Finally, we apply the methods to two real-world datasets, the European Air Transportation Network and the FAO Trade Network, in order to discuss the results that can be drawn from this type of analysis.},

  abstract = {Obesity is now considered a global epidemic and is predicted to become the number one preventive health threat in the industrialized world. Presently, over 60\% of the U.S. adult population is overweight and 30\% is obese. This is of concern because obesity is linked to leading causes of death, such as heart and pulmonary diseases, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The dramatic rise in obesity rates is attributed to an environment that provides easy access to high caloric food and drink and promotes low levels of physical activity. Unfortunately, many people have a poor understanding of their own daily energy (im)balance: the number of calories they consume from food compared with what they expend through physical activity. Accelerometers offer promise as an objective measure of physical activity. In prior work they have been used to estimate energy expenditure and activity type. This work further demonstrates how wireless accelerometers can be used for real-time automatic recognition of physical activity type, intensity, and duration and estimation of energy expenditure. The parameters of the algorithms such as type of classifier/regressor, feature set, window length, signal preprocessing, sensor set utilized and their placement on the human body are selected by performing a set of incremental experiments designed to identify sets of parameters that may balance system usability with robust, real-time performance in low processing power devices such as mobile phones. The algorithms implemented are evaluated using a dataset of examples of 52 activities collected from 20 participants at a gymnasium and a residential home. The algorithms presented here may ultimately allow for the development of mobile phone-based just-in-time interventions to increase self-awareness of physical activity patterns and increases in physical activity levels in real-time during free-living that scale to large populations.},

  abstract = {Autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments face the problem of optimizing their performance whilst satisfying complex mission constraints with high probability and bounding the risk of plan execution failure. Such problems can be modelled as constrained stochastic shortest path problems (C-SSPs), which are an active research topic in the operations research, artificial intelligence, robotics, and software verification communities. However, all existing algorithms for C-SSPs require generating and exploring the entire state space of the problem, making them im- practical for autonomous systems which have huge state spaces. This project has made significant advances towards more practical solutions to C-SSPs. We have devised the first heuristic search algorithms for C-SSPs. These algorithms typically explore a small fraction of the state space, and enable solving much larger problems than was previously possible. To be effective, they must be provided with an admissible heuristic function, that is a lower bound on the expected cost to reach the system goal under the constraints. To achieve this, we have devised the first domain-independent heuristics that take into account uncertainty, costs, and constraints. Our heuristics have become the state of the art also for regular (unconstrained) SSPs: even though heuristic search had been used to solve SSPs for over two decades, existing heuristics ignored uncertainty altogether. Moreover, we have extended these algorithms and heuristics in several directions, including to rich probabilistic temporal logic constraints, to partially observable environments, to hybrid dis- crete/continuous environments, and to efficiently handle dead-ends. In doing so, we have bridged the gap between several areas of research, across several scientific communities, specifically, heuris- tic search, classical planning heuristics and planning under uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, Markov decision processes in Operations Research, synthesis of policies with probabilistic temporal logic objectives in the Formal Verification community, and motion planning in Robotics. Two of the ten top tier project publications have received best paper awards at the Interna- tional Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) in 2016, and 2017, respectively. Applications of these results are underway in collaboration with partners in the aerospace and au- tomobile industries.},

In the process, the executive managed temporal constraints, the AUV's dynamics, and the lagoon's topology. We conclude with lessons learned that will be of interest to the PlanRob community and a plan forward for the deployment of the full exeuctive.},

  abstract = {The Simple Temporal Network formalism permits signiicant exibility in specifying the occurrence time of events in temporal plans. However, to retain this exibility during execution , there is a need to propagate the actual execution times of past events so that the occurrence windows of future events are adjusted appropriately. Unfortunately, this may run afoul of tight real-time control requirements that dictate extreme eeciency. The performance may be improved by restricting the propagation. However, a fast, locally propagating, execution controller may incorrectly execute a consistent plan. To resolve this dilemma, we identify a class of dis-patchable networks that are guaranteed to execute correctly under local propagation. We show that every consistent temporal plan can be reformulated as an equivalent dispatch-able network, and we present an algorithm that constructs such a network. Moreover, the constructed network is shown to have a minimum number of edges among all such networks. This algorithm will be own on an autonomous spacecraft as part of the Deep Space 1 Remote Agent experiment.},

In real domains however, this assumption is commonly violated and certain events are beyond the direct control of the plan's executive. Previous work on reasoning with uncontrollable events (Simple Temporal Problem with Uncertainty) assumes that we can bound the occurrence of each uncontrollable within a time interval. In principle however, there is no such bounding interval since there is always a non-zero probability the event will occur outside the bounds. Here we develop a new more general formalism called the Probabilistic Simple Temporal Problem (PSTP) following a probabilistic approach. We present a method for scheduling a PSTP maximizing the probability of correct execution. Subsequently, we use this method to solve the problem of finding an optimal execution strategy, i.e. a dynamic schedule where scheduling decisions can be made on-line.},

In this paper we present a new algorithm for DTP solving, called Epilitis, which integrates strategies for efficient DTP solving from the previous literature, including conflict-directed backjumping, removal of subsumed variables, and semantic branching, and further adds no-good recording as a central technique. We discuss the theoretical and technical issues that arise in successfully integrating this range of strategies with one another and with no-good recording in the context of DTP solving. Using an implementation of Epilitis, we explore the effectiveness of various combinations of strategies for solving DTPs, and based on this analysis we demonstrate that Epilitis can achieve a nearly two order-of-magnitude speed-up over the previously published algorithms on benchmark problems in the DTP literature. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Temporal Constraint Networks (TCN) allow one to express minimal and maximal durations between time-points. Although being used in many research areas, this model disregards the contingent nature of some constraints, whose effective duration cannot be decided by the system but is provided by the external world. We propose an extension of TCN based on the definition of the Simple Temporal Problem under Uncertainty (STPU) in which the classical network consistency property must be redefined in terms of controllability: intuitively, we would like to say that a network is controllable iff it is consistent in any situation (i.e. any assignment of the whole set of contingent intervals) that may arise in the external world. Three levels of controllability must be distinguished, namely the Strong, the Weak and the Dynamic ones. This paper provides a full characterization of those properties and their usefulness in practice, and proposes algorithms for checking them. Complexity issues and tractable equivalence classes are only partially tackled, since it is still the topic of on-going work. All the same, hardness is discussed and argued, giving evidence for the general intractability of Dynamic controllability, which is the most commonly required property in domains such as planning or scheduling. \textcopyright{} 1999 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Network alignment (NA) aims to find a node mapping that conserves similar regions between compared networks. NA is applicable to many fields, including computational biology, where NA can guide the transfer of biological knowledge from well-to poorly-studied species across aligned network regions. Existing NA methods can only align static networks. However, most complex real-world systems evolve over time and should thus be modeled as dynamic networks. We hypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems will produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static network representations, as is currently done. Results: For this purpose, we introduce the first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA ++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA method is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even though both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation across the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity between static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges (events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods. For this purpose, we introduce the first ever measure of dynamic edge conservation and rely on our recent measure of dynamic node conservation. Importantly, the two dynamic conservation measures can be optimized with any state-of-the-art NA method and not just MAGNA++. We confirm our hypothesis that dynamic NA is superior to static NA, on synthetic and real-world networks, in computational biology and social domains. DynaMAGNA++ is parallelized and has a user-friendly graphical interface.},

Due to the overwhelming complexity, human operators will require the assistance of advanced autonomy decision aids with new mechanisms for operator supervision and management of teams of manned and unmanned systems.

We then discuss a cognitive engineering approach to designing role- and task-tailored human machine interfaces between humans and the autonomous systems.

Consider a planner for an imaging satellite with a camera that cannot tolerate exhaust. The planner would need to determine that opening a valve causes a chain reaction that ignites the engine, and thus needs to shield the camera. While planners exist that support deadlines and durative goals, currently, no planners can handle automatic timed transitions. We present tBurton, a temporal planner that supports these features, while additionally producing a temporally least-commitment plan. tBurton uses a divide and conquer approach: dividing the problem using causal-graph decomposition and conquering each factor with heuristic forward search. The 'sub-plans' from each factor are then unified in a conflict directed search, guided by the causal graph structure. We describe why this approach is fast and efficient, and demonstrate its ability to improve the performance of existing planners on factorable problems through benchmarks from the International Planning Competition.},

This work addresses the chance-constrained scheduling problem, where actions' durations are modeled probabilistically. Our solution method uses conflict-directed risk allocation to efficiently compute a scheduling policy. The key insight, compared to previous work in probabilistic scheduling, is to decouple the reasoning about temporal and risk constraints. This decomposes the problem into a separate master and subproblem, which can be iteratively solved much quicker. Through a set of simulated car-sharing scenarios, it is empirically shown that conflict-directed risk allocation computes solutions nearly an order of magnitude faster than prior art does, which considers all constraints in a single lump-sum optimization.},

  abstract = {Real-world applications of autonomous agents require coordinated groups to work in collaboration. Dependable systems must plan and carry out activities in a way that is robust to failure to and uncertainty. Previous work has produced algorithms that provide robustness at the plan- ning phase, by choosing between functionally redundant methods, and at the execution phase, by dispatching tem- porally flexible plans. However, these algorithms use a centralized architecture in which all computation is per- formed by a single processor. As a result, these imple- mentations suffer from communication bottlenecks at the master processor, require significant computational capa- bilities, and do not scale well. This paper introduces the plan extraction component of a robust, distributed executive for contingent plans. Con- tingent plans are encoded as Temporal Plan Networks (TPNs), which compose temporally flexible plans hier- archically and provide a choose operator. First, the TPN is distributed over multiple agents, by creating a hierar- chical ad-hoc network and mapping the TPN onto this hierarchy. Second, candidate plans are extracted from the TPN with a distributed, parallel algorithm that exploits the structure of the TPN. Third, temporal consistency of the candidate plans is tested using a distributed Bellman- Ford algorithm. This algorithm is empirically validated on randomized contingent plans.},

  title = {Rich {{Vehicle Routing Problems}} and {{Applications}}},
  author = {Wen, Min},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the most important and challenging optimization problems in the field of Operations Research. It was introduced by Dantzig and Ramser (1959) and defined as the problem of designing the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles in order to serve a given set of customers. The VRP is a computationally hard combinatorial problem and has been intensively studied by numerous researchers in the last fifty years. Due to the significant economic benefit that can be achieved by optimizing the routing problems in practice, more and more attention has been given to various extensions of the VRP that arise in real life. These extensions are often called Rich Vehicle Routing Problems (RVRPs). In contrast to the research of classical VRP that focuses on the idealized models with unrealistic assumptions, the research of RVRPs considers those complicated constraints encountered in the real-life planning and provides solutions that are executable in practice. In this thesis, we investigated the models and algorithms of three practical vehicle routing problems. Each of them involves special practical issues that are only considered in very few papers. Our study of these problems was motivated by our cooperation with industrial companies, particularly Transvision A/S and its client distributors, and Danish Crown. The models and methods proposed in the thesis are general and can be applied to practical routing problems arising in many other distribution companies as well. We first consider a vehicle routing problem with cross-docking options, in which products are picked up from suppliers by vehicles, consolidated at the depot and immediately delivered to customers by the same set of vehicles. It is more complex than the traditional vehicle routing problems in the sense that consolidation decisions have to be made at the depot and these decisions interact with the planning of pickup and delivery routes. We presented a mathematical model and proposed a Tabu Search based heuristic to solve it. It is shown that the approach can produce near-optimal solutions within very short computational time on real-life data involving up to 200 pairs of suppliers and customers. The second problem we consider is a dynamic vehicle routing problem with multiple objectives over a planning horizon that consists of multiple periods. In this problem, customer orders are revealed incrementally over the planning horizon. The delivery plan must be made and executed in every period without knowing the future orders. We modeled the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solved it by means of a three-phase heuristic that works over a rolling planning horizon. The method improves the company's solution in terms of all the objectives, including the travel time, customer waiting and daily workload balances, under the given constraints considered in the work. Finally, we address an integrated vehicle routing and driver scheduling problem, in which a large number of practical constraints are considered, such as the multi-period horizon, the time windows for the delivery, the heterogeneous vehicles, the drivers' predefined working regulations, the driving rule etc. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program and treated by a multilevel variable neighborhood search algorithm. The method is implemented and tested on real-life data involving up to 2000 orders. It is shown that the method is able to provide solutions of good quality within reasonable running time.},

Surface roughness values are derived from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud collected in 2004 from a fixed-wing airborne platform. Patterns in surface roughness are characterized using co-occurrence texture statistics. Pristine-pyroclastic, reworked-pyroclastic, mudflow, boulder beds, eroded lava flows, braided streams, and other units within the Pumice Plain are all found to have significantly distinct roughness textures. The MSH deposits are reasonably accessible, and the textural variations have been verified in the field. Results of this work indicate that by affecting the distribution of large clasts and tens-of-meter scale landforms, modification of pyroclastic deposits by lahars alters the morphology of the surface in detectable quantifiable ways. When a lahar erodes a pyroclastic deposit, surface roughness increases, as does the randomness in the deposit surface. Conversely, when a lahar deposits material, the resulting landforms are less rough but more random than pristine pumice-rich pyroclastic deposits. By mapping these relationships and others, volcanic deposit facies can be differentiated. This new method of mapping, based on roughness texture, has the potential to aid mapping efforts in more remote regions, both on this planet and elsewhere in the solar system. \textcopyright{} 1980-2012 IEEE.},

We used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to calculate roughness patterns (homogeneity, mean-roughness, and entropy) for five lava types at two different resolutions (1.5 and 0.1~m/pixel). We found that end-member types ('a'\=a and p\=ahoehoe) are separable (with 95\% confidence) at both scales, indicating that roughness patterns are well suited for analyzing types of lava. Intermediate lavas were also explored, and we found that slabby-p\=ahoehoe is separable from the other end-members using 1.5~m/pixel data, but not in the 0.1~m/pixel analysis. This suggests that the conversion from p\=ahoehoe to slabby-p\=ahoehoe is a meter-scale process, and the finer roughness characteristics of p\=ahoehoe, such as ropes and toes, are not significantly affected. Furthermore, we introduce the ratio ENTHOM (derived from lava roughness) as a proxy for assessing local lava flow rate from topographic data. High entropy and low homogeneity regions correlate with high flow rate while low entropy and high homogeneity regions correlate with low flow rate. We suggest that this relationship is not directional, rather it is apparent through roughness differences of the associated lava type emplaced at the high and low rates, respectively.},

  abstract = {Programming complex embedded systems involves reasoning through intricate system interactions along lengthy paths between sensors, actuators, and control processors. This is a challenging, time-consuming, and error-prone process requiring significant interaction between engineers and software programmers. Furthermore, the resulting code generally lacks modularity and robustness in the presence of failure. Model-based programming addresses these limitations, allowing engineers to program reactive systems by specifying high-level control strategies and by assembling commonsense models of the system hardware and software. In executing a control strategy, model-based executives reason about the models "on the fly," to track system state, diagnose faults, and perform reconfigurations. This paper develops the reactive model-based programming language (RMPL) and its executive, called Titan. RMPL provides the features of synchronous, reactive languages, with the added ability of reading and writing to state variables that are hidden within the physical plant being controlled. Titan executes an RMPL program using extensive component-based declarative models of the plant to track states, analyze anomalous situations, and generate novel control sequences. Within its reactive control loop, Titan employs propositional inference to deduce the system's current and desired states, and it employs model-based reactive planning to move the plant from the current to the desired state.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has traditionally used constraint satisfaction and logic to frame a wide range of problems, including planning, diagnosis, cognitive robotics and embedded systems control. However, many decision making problems are now being re-framed as optimization problems, involving a search over a discrete space for the best solution that satisfies a set of constraints. The best methods for finding optimal solutions, such as A*, explore the space of solutions one state at a time. This paper introduces conflict-directed A*, a method for solving optimal constraint satisfaction problems. Conflict-directed A* searches the state space in best first order, but accelerates the search process by eliminating subspaces around each state that are inconsistent. This elimination process builds upon the concepts of conflict and kernel diagnosis used in model-based diagnosis [J. de Kleer, B.C. Williams, Diagnosing multiple faults, Artif. Intell. 32(1) (1987) 97-130; J. de Kleer, A. Mackworth, R. Reiter, Characterizing diagnoses and systems, Artif. Intell. 56 (1992) 197-222] and in dependency-directed search [R. Stallman, G.J. Sussman, Forward reasoning and dependency-directed backtracking in a system for computer-aided circuit analysis, Artif. Intell. 9 (1977) 135-196; J. Gaschnig, Performance measurement and analysis of certain search algorithms, Technical Report CMU-CS-79-124, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 1979; J. de Kleer, B.C.

Conflict-directed A* is a fundamental tool for building model-based embedded systems, and has been used to solve a range of problems, including fault isolation [J. de Kleer, B.C. Williams, Diagnosing multiple faults, Artif. Intell. 32(1) (1987) 97-130], diagnosis [J. de Kleer, B.C.

  abstract = {On the Feasibility of Stealthily IntroducingVulnerabilities in Open-Source Software viaHypocrite CommitsQiushi Wu and Kangjie LuUniversity of Minnesota\{wu000273, kjlu\}@umn.eduAbstract\textemdash Open source software (OSS) has thrived since theforming of Open Source Initiative in 1998. A prominent exampleis the Linux kernel, which has been used by numerous majorsoftware vendors and empowering billions of devices. The higheravailability and lower costs of OSS boost its adoption, while itsopenness and flexibility enable quicker innovation. More impor-tantly, the OSS development approach is believed to producemore reliable and higher-quality software since it typically hasthousands of independent programmers testing and fixing bugsof the software collaboratively.In this paper, we instead investigate the insecurity of OSS froma critical perspective\textemdash the feasibility of stealthily introducingvulnerabilities in OSS via hypocrite commits (i.e., seeminglybeneficial commits that in fact introduce other critical issues).The introduced vulnerabilities are critical because they may bestealthily exploited to impact massive devices. We first identifythree fundamental reasons that allow hypocrite commits. (1)OSS is open by nature, so anyone from anywhere, includingmalicious ones, can submit patches. (2) Due to the overwhelmingpatches and performance issues, it is impractical for maintainersto accept preventive patches for ``immature vulnerabilities''. (3)OSS like the Linux kernel is extremely complex, so the patch-review process often misses introduced vulnerabilities that involvecomplicated semantics and contexts. We then systematically studyhypocrite commits, including identifying immature vulnerabilitiesand potential vulnerability-introducing minor patches. We alsoidentify multiple factors that can increase the stealthiness ofhypocrite commits and render the patch-review process lesseffective. As proof of concept, we take the Linux kernel as targetOSS and safely demonstrate that it is practical for a maliciouscommitter to introduce use-after-free bugs. Furthermore, wesystematically measure and characterize the capabilities andopportunities of a malicious committer. At last, to improvethe security of OSS, we propose mitigations against hypocritecommits, such as updating the code of conduct for OSS anddeveloping tools for patch testing and verification.},

  abstract = {We propose the first fast and certifiable algorithm for the registration of two sets of three-dimensional (3-D) points in the presence of large amounts of outlier correspondences. A certifiable algorithm is one that attempts to solve an intractable optimization problem (e.g., robust estimation with outliers) and provides readily checkable conditions to verify if the returned solution is optimal (e.g., if the algorithm produced the most accurate estimate in the face of outliers) or bound its suboptimality or accuracy. Toward this goal, we first reformulate the registration problem using a truncated least squares (TLS) cost that makes the estimation insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general graph-theoretic framework to decouple scale, rotation, and translation estimation, which allows solving in cascade for the three transformations. Despite the fact that each subproblem (scale, rotation, and translation estimation) is still nonconvex and combinatorial in nature, we show that 1) TLS scale and (component-wise) translation estimation can be solved in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, 2) TLS rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) and the relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme outlier rates, and 3) the graph-theoretic framework allows drastic pruning of outliers by finding the maximum clique. We name the resulting algorithm TEASER (Truncated least squares Estimation And SEmidefinite Relaxation). While solving large SDP relaxations is typically slow, we develop a second fast and certifiable algorithm, named TEASER++, that uses graduated nonconvexity to solve the rotation subproblem and leverages Douglas-Rachford Splitting to efficiently certify global optimality. For both algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on the estimation errors, which are the first of their kind for robust registration problems. Moreover, we test their performance on standard benchmarks, object detection datasets, and the 3DMatch scan matching dataset, and show that 1) both algorithms dominate the state-of-the-art (e.g., RANSAC, branch-\&-bound, heuristics) and are robust to more than 99\% outliers when the scale is known, 2) TEASER++ can run in milliseconds and it is currently the fastest robust registration algorithm, and 3) TEASER++ is so robust it can also solve problems without correspondences (e.g., hypothesizing all-to-all correspondences), where it largely outperforms ICP and it is more accurate than Go-ICP while being orders of magnitude faster. We release a fast open-source C++ implementation of TEASER++.},

  abstract = {The goal of adaptive sampling in the ocean is to predict the types and locations of additional ocean measurements that would be most useful to collect. Quantitatively, what is most useful is defined by an objective function and the goal is then to optimize this objective under the constraints of the available observing network. Examples of objectives are better oceanic understanding, to improve forecast quality, or to sample regions of high interest. This work provides a new path-planning scheme for the adaptive sampling problem. We define the path-planning problem in terms of an optimization framework and propose a method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The mathematical goal is to find the vehicle path that maximizes the line integral of the uncertainty of field estimates along this path. Sampling this path can improve the accuracy of the field estimates the most. While achieving this objective, several constraints must be satisfied and are implemented. They relate to vehicle motion, intervehicle coordination, communication, collision avoidance, etc. The MILP formulation is quite powerful to handle different problem constraints and flexible enough to allow easy extensions of the problem. The formulation covers single- and multiple-vehicle cases as well as singleand multiple-day formulations. The need for a multiple-day formulation arises when the ocean sampling mission is optimized for several days ahead. We first introduce the details of the formulation, then elaborate on the objective function and constraints, and finally, present a varied set of examples to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. \textcopyright{} 2008 IEEE.},

Recently, developments in X-ray tube and detector technologies have resulted in miniaturized, field-portable instruments that enable new applications both in and out of standard laboratory settings. These applications, however, have not been extensively applied to geologic field campaigns. This study investigates the feasibility of using developing handheld XRF (hXRF) technology to enhance terrestrial field geology, with potential applications in planetary surface exploration missions. We demonstrate that the hXRF is quite stable, providing reliable and accurate data continuously over a several year period. Additionally, sample preparation is proved to have a marked effect on the strategy for collecting and assimilating hXRF data. While the hXRF is capable of obtaining data that are comparable to laboratory XRF analysis for several geologically-important elements (such as Si, Ca, Ti, and K), the instrument is unable to detect other elements (such as Mg and Na) reliably. While this limits the use of the hXRF, especially when compared to laboratory XRF techniques, the hXRF is still capable of providing the field user with significantly improved contextual awareness of a field site, and more work is needed to fully evaluate the potential of this instrument in more complex geologic environments.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty is commonly encountered in temporal scheduling and planning problems, and can often lead to over-constrained situations. Previous relaxation algorithms for over-constrained temporal problems only work with requirement constraints, whose outcomes can be controlled by the agents. When applied to uncontrollable durations, these algorithms may only satisfy a subset of the random outcomes and hence their relaxations may fail during execution. In this paper, we present a new relaxation algorithm, Conflict-Directed Relaxation with Uncertainty (CDRU), which generates relaxations that restore the controllability of conditional temporal problems with uncontrollable durations. CDRU extends the Best-first Conflict-Directed Relaxation (BCDR) algorithm to uncontrollable temporal problems. It generalizes the conflict-learning process to extract conflicts from strong and dynamic controllability checking algorithms, and resolves the conflicts by both relaxing constraints and tightening uncontrollable du-rations. Empirical test results on a range of trip scheduling problems show that CDRU is efficient in resolving large scale uncontrollable problems: computing strongly controllable relaxations takes the same order of magnitude in time compared to consistent relaxations that do not account for uncontrollable durations. While computing dynamically controllable relaxations takes two orders of magnitude more time, it provides significant improvements in solution quality when compared to strongly controllable relaxations.},

Although human intuition is trusted to balance reward and risk, humans perform poorly in risk assessment at the scale and complexity of real world problems. In this paper, we present a decision aid system that helps human operators diagnose the source of risk and manage uncertainty in temporal problems. The core of the system is a conflict-directed relaxation algorithm, called Conflict-Directed Chance-constraint Relaxation (CDCR), which specializes in resolving overconstrained temporal problems with probabilistic durations and a chance constraint bounding the risk of failure. Given a temporal problem with uncertain duration, CDCR proposes execution strategies that operate at acceptable risk levels and pinpoints the source of risk. If no such strategy can be found that meets the chance constraint, it can help humans to repair the overconstrained problem by trading off between desirability of solution and acceptable risk levels. The decision aid has been incorporated in a mission advisory system for assisting oceanographers to schedule activities in deepsea expeditions, and demonstrated its effectiveness in scenarios with realistic uncertainty.},

  author = {Yu, Peng},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Over-subscription, that is, being assigned too many tasks or requirements that are too demanding, is commonly encountered in temporal planning problems. As human beings, we often want to do more than we can, ask for things that may not be available, while underestimating how long it takes to perform each task. It is often difficult for us to detect the causes of failure in such situations and then find resolutions that are effective. We can greatly benefit from tools that assist us by looking out for these plan failures, by identifying their root causes, and by proposing preferred resolutions to these failures that lead to feasible plans. In recent literature, several approaches have been developed to resolve such over- subscribed problems, which are often framed as over-constrained scheduling, config- uration design or optimal planning problems. Most of them take an all-or-nothing approach, in which over-subscription is resolved through suspending constraints or dropping goals. While helpful, in real-world scenarios, we often want to preserve our plan goals as much possible. As human beings, we know that slightly weakening the requirements of a travel plan, or replacing one of its destinations with an alternative one is often sufficient to resolve an over-subscription problem, no matter if the re- quirement being weakened is the duration of a deep-sea survey being planned for, or the restaurant cuisine for a dinner date. The goal of this thesis is to develop domain independent relaxation algorithms that perform this type of slight weakening of constraints, which we will formalize as contin- uous relaxation, and to embody them in a computational aid, Uhura, that performs tasks akin to an experienced travel agent or ocean scientists. In over-subscribed situ- ations, Uhura helps us diagnose the causes of failure, suggests alternative plans, and collaborates with us in order to resolve conflicting requirements in the most preferred way. Most importantly, the algorithms underlying Uhura supports the weakening, instead of suspending, of constraints and variable domains in a temporally flexible plan. The contribution of this thesis is two-fold. First, we developed an algorithmic framework, called Best-first Conflict-Directed Relaxation (BCDR), for performing plan relaxation. Second, we use the BCDR framework to perform relaxation for several different families of plan representations involving different types of constraints. These include temporal constraints, chance constraints and variable domain con- straints, and we incorporate several specialized conflict detection and resolution algo- rithms in support of the continuous weakening of them. The key idea behind BCDR's approach to continuous relaxation is to generalize the concepts of discrete conflicts and relaxations, first introduced by the model-based diagnosis community, to hybrid conflicts and relaxations, which denote minimal inconsistencies and minimal relax- ations to both discrete and continuous relaxable constraints. In addition, we present the design and implementation of Uhura, the integrated plan advisory system that incorporates BCDR for resolving over-subscribed temporal plans. Uhura can efficiently produce a relaxed plan for the user to support multiple, interrelated constraints and activities. We have applied Uhura to different types of plans to illustrate the practical generality of our approach, which includes deep- sea exploration, job-shop scheduling and transit system management. Results from the computational experiments we performed also show that BCDR is one to two orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms that build on state-of-the-art numerical solvers, making it an effective approach for many large-scale plans in the aforementioned domains.},

  abstract = {A Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) is a formalism able to model temporal plans subject to both conditional constraints and uncertain durations. The combination of these two characteristics represents the uncontrollable part of the network. That is, before the network starts executing, we do not know completely which time points and constraints will be taken into consideration nor how long the uncertain durations will last. Dynamic Controllability (DC) implies the existence of a strategy scheduling the time points of the network in real time depending on how the uncontrollable part behaves. Despite all this, CSTNUs fail to model temporal plans in which a few conditional constraints are under control and may therefore influence (or be influenced by) the uncontrollable part. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Conditional Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty and Decisions (CSTNUDs) which introduce decision time points into the specification in order to operate on this conditional part under control. We model the dynamic controllability checking (DC-checking) of a CSTNUD as a two-player game in which each player makes his moves in his turn at a specific time instant. We give an encoding into timed game automata for a sound and complete DC-checking. We also synthesize memoryless execution strategies for CSTNUDs proved to be DC and carry out an experimental evaluation with (Figure presented.), a tool that we have designed for CSTNUDs to make the approach fully automated.}

However, in situations where communication may be delayed, unavailable or costly, such as when a suite of underwater vehicles is scouting an underwater area in the ocean, pre-coordination is needed beforehand to compensate for limited communication. Previous work proposed decou- pling algorithms for Multi-Agent Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (MaSTNU) in order to find decoupled ex- ecution strategies for the agents, including communication strategy, that satisfy all the inter-agent temporal constraints. However, there is often the coupling between temporal and state constraints, such as the constraint that the vehicles may only communicate with each other when they are within a certain distance. In this paper, we propose using Multi-Agent Qualitative State Plan (MaQSP) that extends MaSTNU to in- cluding continuous state constraints in order to model multi- agent plans with coupled state and temporal constraints. We describe a decoupling algorithm for MaQSP using a mixed- integer linear programming (MILP) encoding, which includes a novel path planning algorithm under temporal uncertainty.},

This article explains the licensing policy and key influences, including, the copyright law of the People's Republic of China and the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). The University approved the Global University Publications Licence, with implementation from 1 August 2019. It is available in Chinese and English. Since implementation, the University has retained rights for 74\% of research publications submitted. 100\% of those publications are available through the University with a CC-BY licence and zero embargo. The open scholarship model provides an equitable approach to versions and citation. The article concludes by suggesting university libraries can exploit copyright law in China to progress open scholarship strategies, including recognition of employers as authors of works, a priority right to the exploitation of works and an embargo protection of two years after the completion of the work. The author's final version of publications can be open, discoverable, cited and preserved through trusted universities with global reputations for high-quality research.},

  abstract = {Distributed constraint satisfaction problems (DisCSPs) are composed of agents, each holding its own variables, that are connected by constraints to variables of other agents. Due to the distributed nature of the problem, message delay can have unexpected effects on the behavior of distributed search algorithms on DisCSPs. This has been recently shown in experimental studies of asynchronous backtracking algorithms (Bejar et al., Artif. Intell., 161:117-148, 2005; Silaghi and Faltings, Artif. Intell., 161:25-54, 2005). To evaluate the impact of message delay on the run of DisCSP search algorithms, a model for distributed performance measures is presented. The model counts the number of non concurrent constraints checks, to arrive at a solution, as a non concurrent measure of distributed computation. A simpler version measures distributed computation cost by the non-concurrent number of steps of computation. An algorithm for computing these distributed measures of computational effort is described. The realization of the model for measuring performance of distributed search algorithms is a simulator which includes the cost of message delays. Two families of distributed search algorithms on DisCSPs are investigated. Algorithms that run a single search process, and multiple search processes algorithms. The two families of algorithms are described and associated with existing algorithms. The performance of three representative algorithms of these two families is measured on randomly generated instances of DisCSPs with delayed messages. The delay of messages is found to have a strong negative effect on single search process algorithms, whether synchronous or asynchronous. Multi search process algorithms, on the other hand, are affected very lightly by message delay. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},
